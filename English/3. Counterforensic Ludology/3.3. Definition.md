Counterforensic ludology is a critical practice that examines and disputes the representation of state violence in board games. This practice analyzes traces of the simulation of state violence and uses them to articulate narratives from the victims' perspective.

It is based on the counterforensic device, a theoretical-practical assemblage that recognizes the inherent ideological tensions in games and provides tools to expose and address these tensions through the reconstruction of residual information.

In a counterforensic exercise, experimental techniques such as Object-oriented inquiry and reflexive digitization are applied to recover and analyze evidence that reveals simulated state violence within the game. Then, through critical intervention, this evidence is used to reconstruct the victims' stories.

The results of a counterforensic exercise are threefold. First, on a research level, practitioners gain expert knowledge of the ideological load of the board game. Second, on a practical level, a network of critical artifacts is generated that makes the victims' case visible and raises awareness of ludic discourses that legitimize state violence. Finally, on a political level, existing forums are engaged, and new forums are created where this emerging truth is disputed from the victims' perspective.
