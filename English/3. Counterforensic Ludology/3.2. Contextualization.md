In this subchapter, I explain the context of counterforensic ludology. First, I situate my work within the traditions of game subversion in postcolonial societies. Then, I present the theoretical and practical needs that drive me to approach games from a counterforensic perspective.
## 3.2.1. Tradition of Subversion
As a Peruvian and Latin American, my work as a game designer and researcher is rooted in the critical tradition of my region and country, which is currently articulated as a response from precarity to the socio-technical hegemony of North Atlantic countries, primarily the United States. This political relationship can also be understood in terms of postcolonialism, as it challenges structures of power and dependence that have persisted since the colonial era and, with globalization, have expanded and deepened on a global scale (Quijano, 2014).

The condition of precarity has been defined as: "the conditioned access to infrastructure, education, culture, quality of life, mobility and so on: conditioned by market demands, geographical location, public perception and political interests" (Messias, Amaral, & Oliveira, 2019). This condition of precarity compels individuals, teams, and communities to generate strategies that allow them not only to access these services and products but also to appropriate, question, and subvert them. In the case of information technologies, this praxis has been described as hacking or technological disobedience, which enables "the prolongation of objects’ lifespan, beyond their induced expiration or planned obsolescence from manufacture" and the transformation of "the possible uses of objects, generating adaptations or combinations that deviate from their intended and pre-designed uses" (Sienra, 2023, p. 84).

In the specific case of games, the body of academic work dedicated to researching cultures and practices of subversion and critical design is notably growing (Penix-Tadsen, 2019; Wong, 2021). However, based on my own experience, I can attest that it remains insufficient to capture the expanding ecosystem of communities, markets, and discourses related to these practices. This can be explained—partially—by the subordinate position that technological dissent occupies within the official discourses on digital culture in the region, as well as by the limited attention that official institutions—whether design schools or governments—allocate to these practices.
## 3.2.2. (Counter)forensic Tradition in Latin America
Now I want to briefly refer to the forensic and counterforensic tradition in my region. This will allow the reader to gain greater clarity regarding my positionality as a game researcher and designer.

In Latin America, there exists a long and painful history of state violence against citizens, particularly the most vulnerable. From the *Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada* in Argentina to the hidden graves of the *Ayotzinapa* students in Mexico, Latin America holds numerous imprints of crimes perpetrated by states against their citizens. These unending cycles of violence have led Latin American societies to constantly re-examine their past, as a means of healing, rebuilding social bonds, and directing efforts towards making their fragile democracies viable. Forensic and counterforensic approaches are deeply rooted in the political, legal, and scientific traditions of Latin America, serving as essential tools to untangle the complex webs of repression and state violence that have marked the region:

>The main actors in this process are the forensic anthropology teams through a scientific and technical process that have enabled the localization of remains, give clues about repressive strategies, and above all have had an influence on changing the narrative of what happened. (Dutrénit, 2013).

This search for truth on behalf of victims has also influenced other forums, such as the artistic realm. Forensic work has become part of the landscape that depicts Latin American violence, with forensic agents portrayed in film and literature. Similarly, a counterforensic perspective has engaged with artistic and political work, reinterpreting the remnants of violence to construct narratives of memory, resistance, and reconciliation.

A recent example is the artist Karen Palacio (Palacio, n.d.), known as kardaver, who has appropriated released data on Operation Condor. Palacio works with records from the covert, systematic plan of military, economic, and ideological intervention carried out by the United States in Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s, using them to create new mnemonic artifacts. Palacio's work challenges official memory forums through art and subversive engineering, contributing to the creation of new forums.
## 3.2.3. Why Counterforensic Ludology?
The previously presented context gives rise to a specific need: the creation of a theoretical-practical framework that enables the study and contestation of the representation of state violence in board games. While a critical body of work already exists to study the representation of state violence in media and digital games, in my research for this thesis project, I have not found similar frameworks addressing board games. Additionally, I have not encountered studies on board games that explore the potential of residual information generated by simulations to deepen the examination of ludo narratives articulated by games, or to construct counterhegemonic texts that subvert these narratives.

The wounds of state violence against its population rarely heal. Even after violent operations cease, struggles continue in political, scientific, judicial, and cultural forums over the construction of narratives that explain—or, rather, justify—this violence. In this context, counterforensic practice has proven valuable for strengthening justice-seeking processes and reestablishing social bonds. With this same impetus, I present counterforensic ludology as a practice that exposes and contests the narratives games construct to legitimize state violence. I believe this practice advances the study and design of board games—especially in Latin America—by providing theoretical and practical tools to examine and subvert them. Furthermore, I consider that this practice has the potential to expand the range of forums in which board games can currently participate as interlocutors.
