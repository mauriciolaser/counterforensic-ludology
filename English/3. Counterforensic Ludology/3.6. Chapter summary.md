This chapter was created as a standalone document to provide an understanding of the principles and procedures of counterforensic ludology.

First, I presented the principles and foundations of counterforensic ludology. I introduced the forensic gaze as a lens that enables the investigation of objects as sensors capable of capturing and expressing information about their surroundings. I then presented the concept of the residual as the network of excessive signifiers produced by a systemic artifact as it expresses itself, but which remain inactive and below the threshold of detectability. I explained that these can be examined to reveal the internal power operations of artifacts as well as the ideological tensions between their dominant and subordinated texts. I continued by presenting the counterforensic as a practice that subverts the forensic texts produced by state apparatuses in order to expose and challenge the violence of these apparatuses, giving voice to the victims through the interpretation of residual traces of violence. Finally, I introduced the counterforensic device as a theoretical-practical-political apparatus that enables three lines of critical work with material culture: an analytical line, to study the residual information of cultural objects; a practical line, to reconfigure these objects against their dominant discourses; and a political line, aimed at clarifying state violence and enabling victims to articulate their truths.

In the second subchapter, I contextualized the counterforensic within postcolonial critical traditions, specifically those of Latin America, where there is a history of state violence and a need for practices that challenge hegemonic narratives.

In the third subchapter, I defined counterforensic ludology as a critical practice that examines and disputes the representation of state violence in board games. I also explained that this practice analyzes the traces of simulated state violence occurring below playersâ€™ threshold of detectability and uses them to construct narratives from the perspective of the dominated, the victims of the violence.

In the next subchapter, I presented the components of counterforensic ludology, namely, game entities as objects that record information about state violence; game residues as a source of information on violence that occurs below the threshold of detectability during simulation; the game state as a research tool for reconstructing events and tracking the trajectory of game entities; game scenarios as sites where violence occurs; the laboratory as a space for processing evidence; the mediators who interpret and present the evidence; and the forums where narratives about state violence are contested.

Finally, I described the procedures of counterforensic ludology based on my own practice and a review of the procedures presented by Keenan and Weizman (2015) and Weizman (2020), which include risk mitigation, case review, evidence collection, evidence processing and analysis, case preparation, and case presentation. I emphasized how this approach seeks to expand critical analysis and board game design, providing tools to expose and subvert hegemonic discourses and fostering new spaces for dialogue and understanding of state violence and its representation in games.
