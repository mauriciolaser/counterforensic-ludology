In this section, I describe the procedure for counterforensic intervention in board games. First, I explain the ethical considerations that must be considered to carry out this type of work. Then, I present the organized procedure, which synthesizes my critical practice with board games and the forensic practice framework proposed by Weizman (3.1).
## 3.5.1. Mitigating risks
During the presentations of this project in academic forums, potential risks of working with the representation of state violence were raised. In particular, the risk for researchers of compromising their safety by exposing themselves to these representations was noted, especially when they must assume the role of perpetrators of such violence. Additionally, concerns were raised about the possibility of re-victimizing victims through the creation of artifacts that, in their attempt to be critical, might reproduce historical and social patterns of violence.

I believe that these situations can be mitigated through four concrete actions: establishing ethical guidelines for game development, reviewing sources and validating products with experts, choosing an appropriate methodology for working with source material, and having institutional support.

Working with problematic cultural objects, such as propaganda artifacts, requires strong ethical principles. In this regard, establishing specific guidelines and rules for the project—as well as adhering to the standards of the institutions that support it—is essential for conducting it ethically. Additionally, making the objectives and research and development procedures transparent in counterforensic game projects facilitates scrutiny and fosters trust among audiences and communities.

Given the risk of inadequately representing victims of historical traumas, it is essential that the project is based on a thorough review of sources and is supported by consultation with experts in the topics addressed. Counterforensic work demands diverse specializations, particularly a solid foundation in sociology and history. Furthermore, it should have the input of experts and individuals recognized as authorities in the field who can validate the project [A].

Regarding methodology, it must meet the research and design objectives of the counterforensic exercise while ensuring the researcher’s safety by mitigating their potential exposure to difficult knowledge. In the appendix of this thesis, I explain how reflexive digitization allows for an in-depth investigation of the systems and events of a board game without the need to reproduce problematic roles. Lastly, institutional support is essential for undertaking this type of project safely. In my experience with Juden Raus!, the project was monitored and supervised by my thesis advisor, Thomas Apperley, who ensured my safety during the development of this work.

[A]: This final requirement has not been met so far, and for this reason, none of the versions of *Juden Raus!* created for this thesis have been made public.
## 3.5.2. Case Review
As with criminal investigation, counterforensic intervention with games begins with a case review. This case review comprises two processes that I explain below: specifically, the review of the game’s cultural status and of the critical work that other parties have previously carried out.

The first activity involves reviewing sources that explain the context of the game’s production and consumption, as well as those that document analyses from various perspectives and the critical interventions performed with the game.

The second activity is the critical analysis of the game, conducted from a ludological perspective focused on the representation of state violence and its victims. I have previously mentioned that there are two limitations to the study of state violence in board games: first, that it manifests below the threshold of player detectability; and second, that it is rare for the victims and their trajectories to be acknowledged by the game’s narrative. Due to this, the selected observation and analysis methods must broaden the field of vision and allow for the collection of evidence of violence against victims, even when it occurs below the detectability threshold. I believe that reflexive digitization, described in the Appendix, meets these requirements and offers advantages for game analysis and subsequent intervention.

Following the case study, a broad understanding of the game model and its rhetoric on state violence has been achieved. More precisely, it has been possible to identify the game’s systems, entities, and events that are directly related to the simulation of state violence. At the end of this stage, this knowledge is systematized into knowledge objects—documents and tools that facilitate its critical intervention, such as game logs, game design documents, and the game code.
## 3.5.3. Evidence Collection
During the case review, I identified game scenarios in which state violence is enacted against entities representing marginalized populations. The goal of the next stage is to collect evidence of the acts of state violence simulated in the game.

The first step in this procedure is to extract and delimit the scenarios of violence so that, at least in analysis, they are distinguishable from other game scenarios. To do this, the conditions within the game system that enable these scenarios are identified, as well as the properties, behaviors, and relationships of the entities involved. The primary resource for extracting scenarios is the game log, an organized representation of the game system’s state and the behavior of its entities at any given moment during gameplay. By analyzing the game log as a text, it is possible to identify events in which state violence occurs and the behavior of all entities involved in those events. Once extracted, the scenario is reconstructed in a format that facilitates its processing and analysis; for example, in graphic schemes or working boards.
## 3.5.4. Evidence Processing and Analysis
The purpose of the evidence processing and analysis stage is to organize, examine, and interpret the traces of state violence produced by the game system. To this end, information is extracted from the evidence gathered in previous stages and used to reconstruct events and determine the "responsibility" of the entities involved.

I have explained that, in board games, state violence occurs below the threshold of detectability and that, often, the victims themselves are not represented as entities in the game. When this happens, it is important to turn to the residues of violence recorded by the system to reconstruct the victims, whether individuals or entire populations. This allows for the reconstruction of crimes from a broad perspective, not only from the forensic view of the game. This strengthens the case and subsequently enables the articulation of new counterhegemonic narratives centered on the victims. Additionally, reconstructing the trajectories of the perpetrators allows for an understanding of the responsibility of agents of state violence.

To understand the victims' trajectory, I use the narrative inquiry method presented in section 3.4.1. In this way, I question the game’s entities (Weizman, 2015, p. 31) with the following questions:

⦁	Where have you been?
⦁	What happened to you? When? Where?
⦁	Who is responsible for what happened to you?

For the perpetrators, the questions posed are:

⦁	What have they done? When? Where? With what?
⦁	Who has been affected?

I also inspect other entities related to scenarios of violence, such as buildings, vehicles, or tools. At the end of this process, I have information on the trajectory of each victim and perpetrator during each game scenario.
## 3.5.5. Case Preparation
After the evidence processing and analysis activities, the necessary resources are available to build the victims' case. During preparation, the forums are analyzed, and rhetorical strategies are devised for presenting in each of them. Following the strategy, the evidence processed in the forensic investigation is used to create a network of critical artifacts that contain and express the victims' truths.

The first step is to review the forums in which the intervention will take place. The rules, procedures, expectations, and rhetorical cultures of each forum must be considered during the case preparation process. Universities, courts, public spaces, and gaming clubs are all forums in which interventions may occur, but each has its particularities.

The second step is to construct a rhetorical strategy. This involves considering the rules of each forum, the ideological guidelines and rhetorical preferences of its interpretive community, as well as the practitioners’ own positionality concerning the simulated acts of violence and the objects intervened.

The third step is to create artifacts that articulate the victims' truth. These artifacts do not necessarily have to be board or digital games; ludic artifacts can be created to intervene in gaming clubs, while academic artifacts can be developed for presentation on a university panel.

Finally, the interpreters of the objects in front of the forums must prepare to facilitate the achievement of the rhetorical goals of the artifacts.
## 3.5.6. Case Presentation
The final process of the counterforensic exercise is the presentation of the case before one or more forums. At this point, following the outlined rhetorical strategy and the rules and procedures of each forum, the interpreters facilitate the display of the constructed artifacts. These will be subject to interrogation and questioning, and the interpreters must facilitate the interpretation of questions and answers. The emerging inquiries and questions will constitute important resources for directly improving the artifacts and expanding the field of discussion on the victims' truth within that forum.
