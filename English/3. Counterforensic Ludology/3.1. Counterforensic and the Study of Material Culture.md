In this subchapter, I outline the theoretical foundations of the counterforensic device. First, I introduce the concepts of material aesthetics, forensic aesthetics, and forensic materiality, which serve as a basis for the forensic perspective; second, I address the concept of the residual within the forensic framework; third, I analyze the terms forensic, anti-forensic, and counterforensic, highlighting their similarities and differences; then, I detail the nature of the counterforensic device; and finally, I present the value of this perspective for the study and subversion of material culture.
## 3.1.1. The Forensic Gaze
The *forensic gaze* is a lens for the investigation of objects that "scans for clues" (Jones, 2022, p. 65). [E]

[E]: This perspective has had a significant impact on popular culture (e.g., in detective series), and from a critical standpoint, it has been observed as a "fundamental aesthetic closely tied to post-9/11 extensive surveillance discourse (...) and the broader context of the post-panopticon" (Elyamany, 2022). There is a growing body of reflection and research on the influence of this perspective on popular culture, but I consider this to be beyond the scope of this thesis. I have chosen to use a specific definition of the concept to theorize about my own critical practice.

The condition of material aesthetics refers to the inherent capacity of material objects to function as sensors that record changes in their environment:

>Matter can be seen as an aesthetic sensor insofar as its formal transformations register the different forces around it. Material aesthetics is primary, preceding human perception, apprehension, and judgment. (...) While aesthetics is generally understood as belonging to human senses and perception, "material aesthetics," however, captures the way in which matter absorbs or acquires (rather than apprehends or comprehends) its surroundings. (Weizman, 2020, p.138).

Viewed this way, material objects "perceive and communicate" with each other without human intervention. This non-sensory perception allows them to register information about what occurs in their environment, even when it happens below the threshold of human detectability. Thanks to this material condition, analytical work enhanced by science and technology can extract this information from objects, expanding knowledge about the situation or environment that these objects "witnessed."

The forensic aesthetic condition includes the material aesthetic condition but grants objects an additional capability: to express themselves through a mediator to an audience:

>"(Forensic aesthetics) refers to the way things are presented. It involves various techniques and technologies for display—rhetorics and performance, gestures, narrative and dramatization, image enhancement, and projection." (Weizman, 2020, p.139).

This enables objects to participate in rhetorical exercises in which they support a thesis, while also allowing other parties to pose questions and dispute their expression. Of course, objects cannot speak for themselves, and it is the role of the mediator, an expert in the objects, to ensure the validity of what they and the objects assert. In this sense, Keenan and Weizman have defined objects and their mediators as a rhetorical unit:

>Since the object and its interpreter form a single, interconnected rhetorical unit, refuting a statement attributed to the object requires dismantling the mechanism of its articulation; that is, by showing the object is inauthentic, the interpreter is biased, or communication between them is short-circuited. One might say the object and its 'friend' do not speak the same language, either because the expert misinterprets or, more radically, because the so-called discourse of the object wholly originates with its would-be advocate. (Keenan & Weizman, 2015, p. 46-47)

Forensic materiality is the recognition of the uniqueness of objects (Jones, 2022). No two identical objects can exist in the same place and time, and, due to their own sensory capacities, these objects record information in their materiality about that place and time. This makes objects witnesses—or even agents—that carry a portion of the truth.

Therefore, in this work, we refer to the forensic gaze as the lens that enables the interpretation and analysis of events occurring in the world, including those that fall below the threshold of human detectability, leveraging the aesthetic and forensic capacities of the objects involved in them.
## 3.1.2. The Residual
The residual is a key concept for the forensic and critical practices that employ the forensic perspective, but even before that, it is a concept deeply embedded in people’s everyday lives. We all produce and deal with residues. The Oxford English Dictionary defines residue (n.d.) as “the remainder, the rest; that which is left of things or persons.” This broad definition encompasses everything left of an object (thing or person) that is no longer present. Meanwhile, the Real Academia Española (n.d.) defines the residual as “relating to residue,” which it defines as “material left as useless after completing a task or operation.” This definition aligns more closely with the critical systemic perspective of my work because it acknowledges two additional characteristics of residues: that they result from operations or work and their uselessness.

Systemic artifacts are expressed procedurally, that is, through operations involving rules and objects (Bogost, 2006). Systems generate multiple signifiers during these operations, but only some are articulated and recognized as the artifact’s dominant texts (2.1). The elements that result from the expressive operations of artifacts and are not incorporated into the emergent dominant texts constitute the residual signifiers. These inactive and forgotten signifiers exist below the threshold of detectability. I refer to the network of these residual elements generated by the expressive operations of systemic artifacts as “the residual.”

The residual can be imagined as a repository of evidence of the ideological tensions inherent in cultural objects. These are, after all, what the artifact’s rhetorical apparatus uses to express itself but discards and conceals because they might reveal it. Residues are deemed useless from the dominant perspective of the system, though their uselessness is a state, not a permanent condition. From a forensic perspective, all objects contain information about themselves, other objects, and the world, waiting to be heard and interpreted. In forensic and counterforensic exercises, these useless objects are retrieved from the residual plane and reconfigured to expand our understanding of the operations that produced them.

What happens when we create new texts from residues? Residues tell grand stories that expand and challenge the signifiers inhabiting the dominant plane, though they often go unnoticed. For environmentalists, Taylor Swift’s CO₂ emissions tell a story of massive resource waste in late capitalism. For Beatles fans, the residues hidden in their songs are an endless source of rediscovery. As I explain further, these residues can be used to articulate texts that expose the rhetorical operations of objects and challenge their dominant texts.
## 3.1.3. The Forensic, the Anti-forensic, and the Counterforensic
The term forensic, derived from the Latin root *forensis*, refers to something belonging to the forum, especially a judicial or legal forum (Real Academia Española, n.d-a), as well as to "the practice and skill of creating an argument before a professional, a politician, or a legal council" (Keenan & Weizman, 2015, p. 45). Weizman, examining the origins of the forum, makes this observation about the functioning of that space:

>The forum was a chaotic and multidimensional realm of economy, circulation, politics, and judgments in which both people and objects participated and were represented. Small objects, like coins or daggers, could be physically displayed, but abstract, distant, or overly large matters such as rivers, territories, wars, peoples, famines, or empires had to be made vivid through the power of aural representation or demonstration—what Quintilian referred to with the rhetorical term "prosopopoeia," the attribution of a voice to inanimate matters.

The Roman forum Weizman depicts is a space not restricted to the judicial; it is an arena where matters of public interest are debated. He also notes that, within this space, objects function as interlocutors, represented and participating in the forum’s rhetorical displays.

With the advent of modern society and the consolidation of state apparatuses for population control, the concept and practice of the forensic became restricted, stripped of its critical dimension, and aligned with state apparatuses:

>The forum (…) began to be confined exclusively to legal courts, and 'the forensic' to the use of science within them, primarily medicine. The critical dimension of the forensic—its public and political element—was lost in the process. Thus, forensic science has become the art of the police (Weizman, 2020, p. 90).

But what happens when the State itself is on trial? How does the forensic operate when the violence under investigation has been committed by the State and occurs outside the framework of the law? Today, states hold "the monopoly on forensic resources," as they have extensive and robust technological, legal, and political apparatuses that allow them to maintain an advantageous position in defending themselves before forums (Weizman, 2020, p. 98). Seen this way, the search for truth by victims of state violence is orchestrated as an asymmetric dynamic, where entities, institutions, technologies, and bodies of knowledge that are ostensibly meant to protect them operate in their own interest.

The anti-forensic has been defined within the scope of cybersecurity as tools and techniques aimed at frustrating forensic activity (Garfinkel, 2007). Anti-forensics obscure objects, rendering them useless for use by state institutions in judicial forums; however, it is also a practice used by individuals and communities to protect themselves from state violence. An example includes protesters covering their faces to avoid detection by security cameras or hackers disabling surveillance systems in similar contexts.

The counterforensic is a civil practice that not only encompasses acts of resistance against state power apparatuses but also subverts them to expose and contest acts of violence that these commit against their own citizens. This resistance is manifested through acts of opacity—as in the case of anti-forensics—and transparency. Acts of transparency aim to identify and reveal state violence and the military, political, and judicial operations that states conduct to conceal it. Making state crimes transparent is a process that involves not only collecting, processing, and analyzing evidence of violence but also presenting such evidence in institutionalized forums such as courts, as well as creating and claiming new forums where state violence is hidden, ignored, or, worse, legitimized. In this sense, counterforensic practice constructs a network of artifacts—texts—in different languages that occupy and generate spaces for interpretation and assimilation.
## 3.1.4. The Counterforensic Device
The counterforensic device is a theoretical, practical, and political assemblage that examines, exposes, and contests the truth about state crimes across various forums. Theoretically, it builds on forensic aesthetics, which recognizes objects as capable of recording occurrences beneath the threshold of human and institutional detectability and of being analyzed and interpreted to communicate these records. Practically, the counterforensic device is interdisciplinary, integrating knowledge and techniques from medical sciences, law, engineering, physics, art, design, and other fields to recover, examine, and present evidence of illegitimate state violence. Politically, the counterforensic positions itself as a challenge to power, particularly the ways its institutions exercise violence against the population and conceal it. It also involves the political act of (re)constructing forums to enable the exposure of individuals, objects, and discourses that institutional spaces prefer to overlook.

Forensic science—and therefore counterforensic practice—involves the relationship between three components: an object, a mediator, and a forum (Keenan & Weizman, 2015, p. 46). The object is the entity that perceives state violence and records it inevitably. However, the object cannot participate in the human world on its own; it requires an agent to facilitate its expression and represent it in the forum. The mediator is the expert and legitimate agent who captures, interprets, and presents the object in the forum. The forum, in turn, is the institutionalized space where cases related to state violence are debated. Each forum is distinct, as it is constituted by its own protocols, platforms, and interpretive communities.

Practically, Weizman notes that the counterforensic operates in three spaces (2020, p. 92): the field, the laboratory, and the forum. The field is the place where violence occurs and where traces of it remain; it is also the space where agents of state power work to conceal the evidence. Forensic investigators enter the field to preserve and recover evidence of state violence, often risking their safety, especially if this occurs in active conflict zones. Once recovered, the evidence is taken to the laboratory.

The laboratory is an institutionalized space that encompasses rules, protocols, tools, and techniques for working with evidence. This is where counterforensic investigators process and analyze violence, making it "speak" for the first time. After interpreting the evidence, forensic workers reconfigure it according to the rhetorical strategy that will be used in presenting the case in the forum. The result of this work in the laboratory is an artifact or a network of artifacts—knowledge objects—capable of conveying, in human-understandable terms, information that is valuable for rhetorical exercises in the forum (Bleeker, Verhoeff, & Werning, 2020). An example includes videos or three-dimensional models presented in hearings when explaining a case.

Finally, from a counterforensic perspective, forums are spaces where the truths about violence are contested. Counterforensic activists intervene in and create spaces where dominant narratives can be questioned, and alternative interpretations of state violence can be explored. More importantly, counterforensic work must enable pathways for restoring social bonds. In this sense, the revelation of victims' truths, even when not adhering to scientific standards stipulated by legal institutions, is fundamental.
## 3.1.5. The Counterforensic and the Subversion of Material Culture
In this work, I approach the subversion of material culture as the act of interfering with cultural objects to reconfigure their original meaning and thus question or challenge their dominant discourses. This subversive act involves recognizing three characteristics of cultural objects: their inherent ideological tensions, their polyphony, and their aesthetic or sensory capacities. Ideological tensions and polyphony have been previously explained as the capacity of cultural objects to incorporate multiple voices that reflect the tensions of the ideas, values, and projects of a society (2.1). Recognizing material aesthetics and forensic aesthetics allows us to consider cultural objects, their creators, and users from new perspectives. The counterforensic perspective accepts that objects perceive and record the world in ways we do not yet fully understand. Moreover, this perspective reveals that objects, their relationships, and behaviors often operate below the threshold of human detectability. This broadens the boundaries of critical analysis of cultural artifacts and allows for the revelation of expressive and ideological operations of objects that occur below the threshold of detectability.

Below, I present three paths of critical and subversive work with material culture enabled by the counterforensic device. For ease of explanation, I describe these paths separately, although in practice, they are part of the same route.

The first path is analytical. The counterforensic device allows us to examine the expressive operations of cultural objects beyond their dominant discourses. More specifically, the counterforensic approach integrates the forensic gaze and acknowledges that objects produce residual information that can be reconstructed or captured for study, with the aim of expanding understanding of the object.
The second path is practical. The counterforensic recognizes that the hidden or residual information of objects—whether written texts, films, photos, or toys—is a resource for reconfiguring the objects themselves against their dominant discourses. Therefore, it uses a broad repertoire of techniques and intervention strategies from various disciplines such as art, engineering, or computing, among others, to construct knowledge objects that function as critical objects.

On a political level, the counterforensic device establishes two main lines. The first is the purpose of the practice, which is to clarify the illegitimate violence that dominant entities in society exercise against the dominated. The counterforensic device, by definition, questions how the State wields and exercises the monopoly of violence. It also focuses on the victims of that violence, who are often systematically marginalized populations. In this sense, counterforensic work with material culture should aim to make visible the excessive and illegitimate violence of the State and allow victims and their communities to articulate their truths and challenge the hegemonic discourses that invisibilize and revictimize them; otherwise, it will merely be forensic work.

The second political line refers to the work of mediators and forums. When the counterforensic device encounters a forum where the truth about violence is disputed, it intervenes. Therefore, mediators "listen" to the objects and devise appropriate strategies that allow their truth to be expressed and their counter-narrative to unfold. Furthermore, when objects and their mediators do not find suitable forums, they create them. Applying this reasoning to work with material culture and objects, the counterforensic device advocates for the reconfiguration and creation of spaces that allow for the presentation of the truth that objects seek to express.
