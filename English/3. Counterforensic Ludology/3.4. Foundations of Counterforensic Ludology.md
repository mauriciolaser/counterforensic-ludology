## 3.4.1. Concepts and definitions
### Ludology
Ludology is defined as the formal study of the structure and elements of games (Frasca, 2013). One of the main contributions of the ludological perspective to the study of digital and board games is its recognition that these generate meaning through behaviors, not only through symbols, as in literature or cinema. In this work, I approach ludology as the formal study of board games, focused on their simulation elements and complemented by the analysis of their representations and performance (Frasca, 2009).
### The counterforensic
The counterforensic is a device that investigates and contests state crimes. Theoretically, it starts with recognizing material objects as receivers and transmitters of information about the world that lies below the threshold of human detectability. Politically, it is rooted in the critical tradition that questions and resists the legitimization of state violence, informing processes of justice and truth-seeking for victims. Practically, it is an interdisciplinary practice that disputes the forensic texts produced by state apparatuses across various forums, such as courts of justice, public squares, and museums.
### Ludology and the counterforensic
Games produce their own forensic texts by design. During and after gameplay, games inform players how to interpret the outcomes of violent actions occurring within the simulation. These forensic texts are products of the game’s dominant structure and are often aligned with its hegemonic narratives. However, this is not the only record the game produces; there exists surplus—residual—information that results from the simulation but is postponed in the dominant text. It is precisely on this excessive and opaque plane of the game that the victims of state violence and their stories are often situated.

The critical work conducted with this residual information enables the emergence of new—counterforensic—texts that expose and challenge the dominant forensic text, which legitimizes and conceals the excesses of simulated violence. In this sense, counterforensic ludology is the critical practice that reveals and contests the dominant narratives of state violence in board games, through the materialization and articulation of counterforensic texts that expose the excessive dimension of the simulation.
## 3.4.2. Components
The forensic and the counterforensic operate through the interaction between objects, mediators, and forums (Keenan & Weizman, 2015, p. 46). To apply this framework to the study of simulated violence in board games, I have adapted the definition of these objects. Below, I clarify what I mean by objects, how mediators relate to them, and how they appear in forums.
### Game entitites as objects
In explaining the forensic, I referred to material aesthetics as the ability of objects to perceive and record changes in their environment, and to forensic aesthetics as the way these objects are interpreted and presented in different forums. The next step is to establish how these aesthetics manifest in both physical and digital board games and how their analysis enhances the study of games’ expression.

In their physical form, board games have material components that represent the game’s entities: for instance, the dog piece in *Monopoly* is a physical component that, during play, represents a specific entity within the game system and a character in the fictional world. In physical board games, it’s evident that components operate within the representational, simulation, and performance layers. On the representational layer, they contribute to articulating the fictional world and allow players to establish a physical connection with it. On the performance level, components structure how players act during gameplay. On the simulation level, the materiality of the components enables tracking their state in the game: the location of a piece on the board—or off it—reveals information about the state of the entity it represents in the system. Players use visual and physical cues to recognize the state of game entities at a given moment, and when these cues are insufficient, they rely on record-keeping tools like tables or notes.

In the digital version of board games, this aesthetic capacity of game entities manifests through properties and relationships. The game entities are visually represented and may even have physical manifestations (haptic technology), but their existence in the game system doesn’t depend on physical state; rather, it relies on the continuous processing and storage activities performed by the game engine. During its operation, the engine records information on the state of each entity’s properties and relationships, which is used by the game’s systems to function.

Information forensics relies on the ability of digital systems to store relevant information about users and their activities. Forensic technicians examine these systems to identify, preserve, recover, and analyze data pertinent to resolving a case. Even when users have attempted to delete evidence from their devices, forensic scientists rely on the computer’s meticulous logging processes to reconstruct and recover information.

Counterforensic ludology operates under similar logic: by translating a board game’s model into a digital format, the process of recording and organizing events (acts of violence) occurring during a simulation is facilitated. This significantly amplifies practitioners’ ability to gather, analyze, and work with evidence of crime simulation that, in the physical version, would be elusive or simply unrepresented.
#### The residues of play
Game systems generate signifiers that shape the ludic and emotional experience of players. After each procedure, the system collects information about its entities, organizes it, and presents it to the player in a way that allows them to understand the consequences of their actions and plan their next moves. I refer to this set of signifiers presented by the game system to players as the dominant text, or the forensic text of the game. However, game systems do not produce only dominant signifiers; they also generate residual signifiers that lie outside the forensic text. Games are typically interpreted according to terms defined by the designers, relegating certain elements to the residual layer. For example, in *Monopoly*, players do not receive information about how many times their pieces have visited jail or how much money they have invested in railroads during a game. This is understandable from a design perspective; after all, the goal is to create an engaging experience, and only those elements that contribute to that experience are prioritized in the dominant layer. In digital versions of board games, this design decision becomes even more evident, as game engines can process and store data on the state of each entity without consuming significant resources; if a player receives no feedback on a game event or their units' state, it is because, for the designers, this information is irrelevant to the experience they wish to create.

A game cannot construct a dominant forensic text without a residual layer to support it. In this sense, we can consider board games as artifacts that produce dominant narratives about political realities, constructed upon stories of violence that are suppressed. The simulated war in *Risk* is a succession of military actions resulting in an outcome: the conquest or loss of a territory. However, if we examine each military action closely, we can confirm that for it to occur, the game system executes a series of procedures that generate residual information. Using this residual information, we could, for example, narrate a game of Risk not in terms of who won, but in terms of how many units were lost during the war, or we could focus on a particular entity and reconstruct the entire game history from the perspective of one artillery unit. In the analog version of board games, this residual text is practically inaccessible, as players do not manually record every game event or the state of each entity. By transferring game entities to a digital medium, the collection of evidence about the actions produced and represented during play becomes easier. Since this is a counterforensic approach that challenges the truth constructed by dominant ideological apparatuses, our interest lies in investigating what occurs below the threshold of detectability, in the residual layer of the simulation. In this sense, counterforensic practice with games recovers and uses this residual information as an interlocutor, thus enabling the reconstruction and analysis of state crime simulations.
#### The Game State as a Research Tool
The representation of the state of entities in a game is known in game design and game design research as the game state. The game state is an immaterial component that results from the organized abstraction and representation of the properties, behaviors, and relationships of the components—both material and immaterial—of a game. Järvinen defines it this way:

>Game state is information which contains data of how the game elements are configured (in relation to each other) and their attributes in one specific moment of time. (p. 51)

The author also distinguishes between *major* and *minor* game states. Major game states relate to the main objectives of the game, such as the score, while minor game states encompass information about lower-priority objectives, like the positions of pieces on a board. In this thesis, which focuses on the game's residual, lower-priority information, I use the term "game state" without differentiating between high- and low-level information.

From the player's perspective, however, the game state can be represented as a text that is never neutral, as it prioritizes certain properties and relationships of entities to summarize the state of the game system:

>Both Tetris and football players spend most of the game dealing with minor game states, but often only the most significant changes in game states are explicitly acknowledged by the game system: the system not only stores this information, but it communicates it explicitly by displaying a change in score, etc. (p. 53)

In board games, the game state can be abstracted by reading the materiality of the game components: the position of pieces on the board, a notepad, a counter. In digital board games, this component is expressed through informational cues displayed on the screen, often as counters and status bars.

Counterforensic ludology is interested in how entities—the objects—perceive the violence that occurs during the simulation. The game state, as an abstraction of the state and trajectory of each entity, holds records of the player's participation in the simulation of state violence, which are critical for conducting this practice.
#### Game scenarios
In a simulation game, scenarios are configurations of the game state—its systems and entities—that can be predictable and reproducible. Game creators are aware of these scenarios when generating the game’s rules and mechanics, using them as reference points during their design processes (Fullerton, 2008, p. 323). Players, in turn, can discern these scenarios and, as their experience grows, gain a deeper understanding of their conditions, functions, and consequences for the simulation’s development.

Game scenarios are the working field of counterforensic ludology. It is in these scenarios where violence occurs and where evidence resides. During an exercise, practitioners delimit, extract, and translate these scenarios to gather evidence, observe its behavior, and conduct experiments to understand how the game model systematically produces violence.
#### The laboratory
Laboratories are institutionalized spaces where evidence is processed, analyzed, and experimented with (Weizman, 2020, p. 93). They have rules, procedures, and tools that allow specialists to work appropriately with the evidence. A laboratory that does not follow established rules and procedures or lacks the proper tools may compromise the integrity of the evidence, rendering it invalid for the forum. Evidence inevitably transforms when processed and analyzed in the laboratory: each interaction with forensic agents, the environment, and their working instruments implies an irreversible change in its material condition. Therefore, practitioners use tools, techniques, and protocols that mitigate and clarify these transformations to preserve the authenticity of the evidence and enable experiments that help answer the case’s questions.

In counterforensic ludology, the laboratory is a virtual space made up of the protocols, techniques, and tools used to study evidence of the simulation of state violence. Protocols are the established procedures that regulate each step of working with game objects, ensuring consistency and rigor in analysis. Techniques are the methodologies for working with the evidence, and tools encompass all technologies involved in the process of analysis and intervention with the game.

When a counterforensic exercise is conducted using digitization as a technique and game engines as tools, transformations occur in the game entities that can amplify the understanding of the evidence and enable new forms of critical work with it. Specifically, this translation of board games to digital systems facilitates the collection of residual information that complements our knowledge of the simulated world and its entities.
### Mediators
Mediators are expert agents—individuals or collectives—that grant agency to objects through their interpretation (Keenan & Weizman, 2015, p. 43). In the investigation of state crimes, mediators are responsible for retrieving and articulating traces of violence to expose the relationship between law enforcement and its victims. In counterforensic ludology, mediators retrieve and articulate evidence of the simulation of state crimes to create artifacts—texts—that expose this violence.

Mediators lead the critical work with the game, taking charge of its examination, preparation, and presentation in forums. During the examination of the object, they use game research and design techniques to understand and extract evidence of its expressive operations. Then, in the preparation stage, they translate the evidence into critical artifacts that facilitate its circulation across different media and languages. Finally, in the forum, they enable the presentation of these critical artifacts.

To act as mediators, practitioners must understand the game’s functioning, especially its model, and be able to interpret its elements and structures to articulate new narratives about the violence it generates. This requires mediators to be familiar with game research and design techniques, as well as to understand the game’s production and circulation context, along with its cultural status. Additionally, in their crucial role as interpreters, mediators clarify their positionality, making transparent the standpoint from which they manipulate and interpret the object.
### Forums
Forums are institutionalized spaces where narratives about state violence are articulated and contested (Weizman, 2020, p. 93). Although a forum is commonly thought of as a court of justice, university classrooms, public squares, museums, and online communities also serve as forums where state violence is discussed. Forums are never neutral; each has its own protocols, rules, and an interpretive community that examines and debates cases. Given this reality, mediators have the task of preparing the evidence and developing rhetorical strategies suited to the needs and characteristics of each forum.

In counterforensic practice, mediators facilitate the presentation of evidence before the forum to challenge the official narratives of the State. Mediators’ work is always carried out at a disadvantage, as the State possesses legal, technological, and discursive resources that allow it to legitimize its violence. Therefore, when the forum conditions are insufficient for presenting a case, practitioners create new spaces that enable the fair presentation of alternative and counterhegemonic narratives.

At the time of this project, the forums in which I have presented the results of a counterforensic exercise have been exclusively academic. Due to the sensitivity of the topics addressed by the game used in the counterforensic exercise, the presentation of the critical artifacts produced has been restricted.
