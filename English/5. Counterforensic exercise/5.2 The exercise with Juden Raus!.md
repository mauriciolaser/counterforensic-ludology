I conducted the exercise with *Juden Raus!* during January and February 2024 and documented the intervention in a research journal hosted on the micro-blogging network Mastodon. Below, I detail this exercise.
## 5.2.1. Case review
**Objective**: To analyze how the board game Juden Raus! represents state violence and its victims.
### Digitization procedures
I conducted the digitization of the game during January 2024.
#### Preparation
Since the physical version of *Juden Raus!* is inaccessible, the first challenge of the project was to reconstruct the game in digital format to enable analysis. The source used to inform the reconstruction was the rule transcription presented by Morris-Friedman and Schädler (2003, p. 50). The concrete outcome of this process was the creation of a game digitization document that includes:

⦁	synthesized game rules,
⦁	an entity map and main game processes,
⦁	safety considerations for game design.
#### *Juden Raus!* - MVP
The “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP) version of *Juden Raus!* (Castro Valdez, 2024) is the first version I developed. The following conditions were established for the game's digitization:

⦁	the algorithmic structure is preserved intact,
⦁	the reproduction of graphic elements is omitted to protect my integrity as a researcher.

This is a minimalist version of the game that does not include graphical representations. The game screen contains only two elements: an action button and a text box. The action button allows players to roll the dice and switch turns. All events occurring during the game are chronologically recorded in the game state. This information is then presented to players in text form.

`[08:20:30 Turn 2] Player 1 rolled the die` 
`[08:20:30 Turn 2] Player 1 rolled a 4` 
`[08:20:30 Turn 2] Player 1 landed at the 'Cohen' business` `[08:20:30 Turn 2] Player 1 capped his unit with a hat`
_Fig. 10. Snippet of Juden Raus! MVP's log (Castro Valdez, 2024) showing the actions of Player 1.

The model's entities (players, police, citizens, buildings) are represented as objects with properties, behaviors, and relationships, and the game algorithms are represented through an *event sheet*.

This version of *Juden Raus!* meets the goal of exposing the game's algorithmic structure without using racist iconography. This allowed me to conduct an initial analysis of the game and its procedural rhetoric safely. Additionally, this exercise revealed that *Juden Raus!* is a game where players make no decisions, with their agency limited to rolling the dice; therefore, a single button suffices to control the game from start to finish.
#### *Juden Raus!* - Alpha
The second iteration of *Juden Raus!* (Castro Valdez, 2024) was built to facilitate experimentation with the game. This version introduces two significant changes compared to the first; specifically, it allows players to track each game entity during gameplay and enables full automation of the sessions. Details follow.

The digitized version of the game offers an expanded view of the information structure of the game entities. In the physical version, most of this information goes unnoticed because it is unnecessary for play, but in the digital version, each entity informs the game system at all times of its current state and trajectory throughout the game. Specifically, the digitized version of *Juden Raus!* allows us to closely track the trajectory of each victim of the game’s violence. By amplifying the game state with the information generated by the game system about each entity, a "micro-view" of the game is enabled, focusing on its entities.

`[18:14:10 Turn 3] Citizen 1 was abducted by Policeman 3` 
`[18:14:10 Turn 3] Citizen 1 was moved from slot 3 to slot 6 by Policeman 3`
_Fig. 11. Snippet of Juden Raus! Alpha's log showing Citizen 1's trajectory._

At the interface level, this version introduces buttons that allow the player to control the flow of information received in text form. This way, the player can check the status of each entity (player, building, police, citizen). It also includes an option to download a game report, containing a chronologically ordered description of all events.

The second significant change in this version is that it enables full game automation. The alpha version includes a settings menu that allows players to set the number of human and computer players. If the player chooses to play solely with computers, the game resolves automatically, and a report of the events is downloaded in text format.
### The dominant narratives of *Juden Raus!*
Previous studies have established that *Juden Raus!* is a racist and supremacist propaganda artifact. This is evident in the representational layer of the game: the game’s title references a slogan popularized by antisemitic groups during the Third Reich, Jewish citizens are depicted with racial stereotypes, and even the board includes an illustration of Jewish people being deported to Palestine. So, what else can the study of *Juden Raus!* reveal?

The analysis conducted during digitization allowed me to identify two rhetorical strategies that have not been addressed in the reviewed studies: the rhetoric of the proliferation of the "other" and the rhetoric of “true player agency”. I argue that these emerging rhetorics also operate on a discursive level to legitimize state violence.
#### A sanitized genocide
By the time of the game’s publication in 1938, the "Jewish question" was already well-established in German public opinion as a social issue, and the fantasy of expelling German Jews to Palestine was seen as a solution. However, neither the German government of 1938 nor *Juden Raus!* explicitly communicated the ultimate purpose of their system: the mass elimination of Jewish people. Both the game and the German state concealed this excessive information from their rhetoric to gain acceptance in German households.

Viewed from its rules, *Juden Raus!* is a family race game that does not display violence. The game rules present five mechanics: “move your figure,” “get a hat” (from the game master), “cap your figure with it” (a hat), “capture a hat” (from another player) or “give a hat,” and “hand the hat in” (at the collection point). Translating these mechanics into the nomenclature proposed by Järvinen (2007, 384-394) gives us the following mechanics: “moving” (your figure/hats), “catching” (hats), “controlling” (hats), “taking” (hats), and “placing” (hats). As Flanagan and Jakobsson (2023) have explained, the pervasiveness of problematic ideologies in board games lies not only in the representation of the game world (racist or supremacist content) but in those innocuous mechanics that represent violent operations (colonization, elimination, land appropriation) and forced displacements.

The descriptions of the mechanics presented in the game’s rules are its dominant descriptions. When we view these mechanics from the perspective of the subaltern subjects in the game—the victims—it becomes clear that these hegemonic forms offer only a limited explanation of what is really happening in the session. The victims are pursued, captured, transferred, moved, and delivered. Articulating these mechanics during analysis reveals that players participate in three dynamics conveniently omitted from the game’s description: kidnapping (“moving” + “catching”), forced transport (“moving” + “controlling”), and imprisonment (“moving” + “placing”).

Through analyzing the reconstructed game, we observe the result of combining these mechanics and dynamics, which is the game’s overarching operation: an efficient process of eliminating marginalized populations, in this case, German Jews. The game normalizes this elimination by presenting a sanitized version of the game’s mechanics and dynamics, packaged as the fantasy of expelling German Jews to Palestine. In this way, players can enact crimes against humanity abstracted as a drastic public policy.
#### The proliferation of the “Other”
The Germany depicted in *Juden Raus!* embodies long-standing stereotypes that continue to fuel supremacist rhetoric today. Hatred directed at ethnic groups often exaggerates their participation in society, particularly in economic and cultural spheres. This rhetoric suggests that the "original" culture is being diluted by the traditions of invading groups and that the productive sector is being overtaken by these same agents. Such rhetoric is not grounded in actual data but in the amplification of ethnic and racial stereotypes. According to the German census conducted in 1933, at the beginning of the Nazi regime, 0.75% of the German population was Jewish, primarily concentrated in urban areas (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.). However, in Nazi rhetoric, the Jewish population's presence in various spheres of German society was pervasive, almost total. In the Germany of *Juden Raus!*, 11% of the city is inhabited by Jewish families, and 100% of local businesses belong to these families. Jews control economic life, and their presence in the city is undeniable.

*Juden Raus!* suggests that the "others," the Jews, are everywhere. Moreover, it warns that these agents proliferate due to their involvement in the country's economic life. The rules state that whenever a player lands on a Jewish-owned business, the "game master" hands them a hat, which they place atop their police figure. Each time a player visits a Jewish business, they take a hat; after all, the "others" proliferate uncontrollably. If a player lands on a Jewish business and finds no one, the game would not be functioning properly, and its rhetoric of proliferation would fail.

The original game includes 36 hat tokens representing German Jews. When played with fewer than six players, the provided tokens are sufficient for the game to function normally. However, a problem emerges during the digital adaptation: with six players, a point is reached where there are not enough hats to continue the game. When the computer evaluates the citizen capture procedure, the system lacks the necessary elements to function; the system fails, the game stops, and the game’s rhetorical exercise ceases. What exactly does this mean?

It is not uncommon for a physical board game to lack the components needed to function. Pieces break, get lost, or are not included in the original package due to a production error. When this happens, players replace them and continue playing. For the digital version, the digitizer must set rules to overcome this crossroads: Should the game stop when this scenario occurs, or should I modify the system's functionality to allow Jews to proliferate until the game halts? A literal translation of Juden Raus! into digital format would reproduce the algorithmic short-circuit and stop the game at that point. This scenario demonstrates that "the Jews are not unlimited" and that there is a game state where the city is depopulated of the "others." A more permissive digitization of the game would involve adjusting the game's algorithmic structure so that it does not stop due to a lack of Jewish tokens. In this adapted system, tokens are not pre-set but are generated procedurally each time a player lands on a Jewish business, allowing the original game's fantasy of "proliferation" to come to fruition.
#### True player agency
What does player agency consist of in *Juden Raus!*? What options are available, what decisions players make, and how do these impact the game? How does this agency relate to the game’s rhetorical operations and the political fantasies of its players? In the following section, I present my reflections on player agency in *Juden Raus!* and the relationship between the player and the game during a session.

Player agency is measured by the capacity to make meaningful decisions that affect the development and outcome of a game [1]. 

[1]: The design of a game can be evaluated in terms of the "interesting choices" it offers the player to make "meaningful decisions."

During the digitization process, I explored player agency through the significant actions and decisions players make throughout the session. For this purpose, I created a player journey, noting every moment the player interacts with game elements and makes decisions, as shown below.

This exercise revealed that players make no meaningful decisions during the session; their actions are limited to the game’s “housekeeping” tasks:

⦁	rolling the dice,
⦁	calculating their police piece's movement,
⦁	moving their police piece on the board,
⦁	selecting a hat from the hat stack,
⦁	placing a hat on their police piece,
⦁	dropping the hats off at the collection point,
⦁	tallying their points and those of their rivals,
⦁	taking a hat from a rival,
⦁	and (if no hats are available and needed) replacing a hat.

An example of the players’ lack of meaningful decisions is that, in digitizing the game, a single "CONTINUE" button suffices to allow the model to function from start to finish.

Interestingly, although the events in this game are predetermined by the system, the final agents who conduct the processes of citizen abduction, transfer, and elimination are the players, not the system [2]. Even in the most minimalist version of the game, the players—or any entity filling their role—are responsible for pressing the button that activates the model’s functions and triggers everything that occurs in the fictional layer. What, precisely, is the relationship between the players and *Juden Raus!*?

[2]: In fact, from the beginning, the game is always resolved.

One of *Juden Raus!*’s most powerful rhetorical operations is convincing players that they have agency while playing. Reflexive digitization reveals that players have no real control within the game; they are merely automatons—or accomplices?— who enable the game’s purpose to be fulfilled. This uncovers the players’ most significant decision: allowing themselves to be used by the artifact. In my view, the relationship between players and the game unfolds as follows: players approach the game aware of its racist content, yet they do not truly play it; rather, they relinquish their agency to allow the game to enact its rhetorical purpose. The game, in turn, requires players to exist (function) beyond its ideal form (its design); for this, it provides players with manual tasks like preparing the board or moving pieces. Viewed this way, players and the game enter into a tacit contract: the game offers players a fictional agency through housekeeping tasks, and players surrender their subjective responsibilities—leaving it to the game to handle the simulated violence.
## 5.2.2. Evidence collection
*Juden Raus!* incentivizes players to commit state crimes with impunity: to win, players must abduct, forcibly transfer, and eliminate German Jewish citizens. However, it reveals little about the perspective of the victims of this violence and their trajectories. The objective of this stage is to inspect the game scenarios that simulate state violence in order to recover evidence that allows us to reconstruct the victims' trajectories.
### Scenario 1: Abduction of Jewish citizens
The first scenario of violence is the abduction of Jewish citizens. In this scenario, three entities interact: specifically, the police, Jewish citizens, and Jewish family businesses. The abduction occurs whenever a player lands on a Jewish business. According to the original rules, the hat representing the Jewish person is placed on top of the player’s token. From that moment, in the analog version of the game, both units are physically assembled. In the digital version, this assembly is expressed through the properties and relationships of the entities involved.

The abduction involves the following procedures carried out by the police entity: 

``roll()``→ the police calculates how many spaces they will move  
``move()``→ based on the roll result, the police moves
``check_business()``→ the police checks the Jewish business entity
``kidnap_citizen()``→ the police captures the Jewish citizen entity

The check_business() and kidnap_citizen() procedures involve the police officers, businesses, and citizens, transforming their values through interaction. By exploring the residual information in the game state, we can identify each victim as well as their captors. We can ascertain each victim's surname (deduced from the family business where they were captured), the time of abduction (in the fictional world), and the location of abduction (position in the fictional world). As for the captors, we can determine which player controls them, how many other victims they have taken, or whether they had another victim in captivity at the time of this abduction.
### Scenario 2: Forced Transfer of Citizens
Once Jewish citizens are captured, players transport them to a *collection point*. During this transfer, while passing through the city center, one police officer may encounter another officer with prisoners. When this happens, the officer arriving in the city center takes the other officer’s prisoners:

`roll()`→ the police calculates how many steps to take with the abducted unit `move()`→ based on the roll result, the police moves 
`check_center()` → the police checks if there is another police in the city center 
`steal_prisoner()` → the police takes the prisoners from the rival

By analyzing this scenario through counterforensic work, we can deduce how many turns each victim has been missing and identify their fellow captives. Additionally, we gather information on the internal tensions within the law enforcement forces.
### Scenario 3: Imprisonment of Jewish Citizens
The third scenario is the imprisonment of Jewish citizens. This scenario occurs when the police arrive at a collection point located outside the city and have prisoners in their custody:

``roll()``→ the police calculates how many steps to take with the abducted unit
``move()``→ based on the roll result, the police moves
``drop_citizen()``→ the police leaves their prisoners at the collection point

This scenario allows us to identify the first point of contact for Jewish citizens with imprisonment. Through the game state, we deduce how many turns it took for the unit to reach prison and which victims they will encounter there. On the police side, this scenario lets us determine how many prisoners they have delivered to the prison.
### Scenario 4: Elimination of Jewish Citizens
The final scenario of violence we explore is the elimination of citizens. As previously explained, under certain conditions, all 36 tokens in the game can be exhausted, leaving no way to continue the session. In the analog version, this can be resolved in three ways: by recycling a unit from the collection point, creating replacement pieces, or keeping score in an external log, such as a notebook. In digitizing the game, I encountered two possible solutions to this problem: ending the game immediately ("the game can’t continue because there are no more Jews in the city") or recycling Jewish citizen units to allow the game to continue. The MVP version of *Juden Raus!* follows the first approach, ending the game when this bug occurs. In contrast, *Juden Raus! - Alpha* presents this decision as a mechanic: to continue, a Jewish prisoner must be recycled (eliminated).

Through counterforensic work, we can trace this process of elimination—and recycling—of citizens:

``roll()``→ the police calculates how many steps to take
``move()``→ based on the roll result, the police moves
``check_business()``→ the police checks the Jewish business entity
``eliminate_citizen()``→ the police eliminates a Jewish citizen
``kidnap_citizen()``→ the police captures the Jewish citizen entity

In this scenario the game state provides us with updated information about the Jewish citizen who has been eliminated; by inspecting it, we can determine how many turns they lived in captivity and establish their date of death.
## 5.2.3. Evidence processing and analysis
The goal of evidence processing is to reconstruct the trajectories of each victim and perpetrator. To understand the victims' trajectories, we ask the game state the following questions:

⦁	Where has the victim been?
⦁	What has happened to the victim? When? Where?
⦁	Who is responsible for what has happened?

For the perpetrators, we pose these questions:

⦁	What actions have they taken? When? Where?
⦁	Who have they affected?

We also inspect the buildings within the game to supplement the case:

⦁	What has happened here? When?
⦁	Who has passed through here? When?

The result of this interrogation of the game state provides complete information on each victim’s and perpetrator’s trajectory during each game session, as demonstrated below:

`[gamestate 1:58:52] The game is over at turn 50` 

`Total German Jews Kidnapped: 47` 
`Total German Jews in Concentration: 36`
`Total German Jews Missing: 11`
`Total German Jews Being Transported: 0`
`Altercation Between Officers: 1`
`Total German Jews Exchanged: 1`

*Fig. 12. Snippet of Juden Raus! Alpha’s log showing the trajectory of a perpetrator.*

In this case, we can track the individual trajectory of a victim from abduction to their fatal end. We know when they were abducted, where, and by whom. We know they were transported for 8 turns before reaching prison, where they died after 3 turns.
## 5.2.4. Case preparation
The ludological analysis of *Juden Raus!* allows us to assert that the game articulates a hegemonic supremacist narrative that suppresses the victims' perspective and legitimizes state violence. Throughout the game, the representational, algorithmic, and performance components work together to create a fantasy of violence against Jewish people in which the player participates as an accomplice. For this reason, the subversive work with Juden Raus! aims to **question the legitimacy of this dominant narrative and to enable the emergence of victim-centered narratives**.
### *Juden Raus! Revisited*
*Juden Raus! Revisited* (Castro Valdez, 2024) is the intervened version I present for this thesis project. This version allows the player to understand and experience the role of victims of antisemitic violence, rather than that of the perpetrator. In this way, Revisited subverts the game’s original rhetorical objective and offers players an experience that questions state crimes.

![[Pasted image 20241028015309.png]]
*Fig. 13. The main screen of Juden Raus! Revisited (Screenshot by author).*
#### How it was done
The intervention was carried out during August 2024 and was documented in a research journal.

The design process aimed to create a game that exposes and questions the hegemonic narratives of the original game, using the residual information generated by the algorithmic structure of the source material. This process followed these rules:

⦁	the game retains the original algorithmic structure,
⦁	the game does not include the racist representations of the original game,
⦁	the game does not introduce new fictional elements, only reconfigures the available information within the game system.

The main resource for constructing this version was the body of evidence collected during the initial stages of the counterforensic exercise. Academic sources consulted and feedback received from peers during my presentations in academic forums were also valuable.

Having established the rhetorical objective as "making state violence visible and telling the story of the victims," my next task was to experiment with the collected evidence. I constructed experimental game modules in which I configured the game information in various ways, enabling new approaches for players to engage with the fictional world. Finally, Revisited presents two modes of use that reconfigure the game data in distinct ways, allowing for two complementary critical experiences: the testimony mode and the investigation mode. I explain them below.
#### Testimony mode
**Rhetorical Objective**
To challenge the hegemonic narrative of hatred present in the original material.

**Theme**
The experience of Jewish citizens facing state violence during the Third Reich.

**Game objective**
To survive Nazi captivity.

**Components**
The game is available in digital format. To play, a computer with a web browser and a mouse or touchpad is required. The player interacts with the system by pressing a text box. 

The game is purely text-based and is expressed in the second person, as shown in this snippet:

``A member of the Hirschfeld family has disappeared``
``You have been kidnapped by a Policeman 2``
``You have been moved by Policeman 2 by 4 squares.``

*Fig 14. Testimony mode.*

**Gameplay**
The testimony mode places the player in the role of a victim of German police violence during the Third Reich. During each turn, the player receives information about what is happening in the city and with their family. At the start of the game, the player is a Jewish citizen gradually learning about acts of violence occurring in their neighborhood. Depending on their fate, the player will either remain an external witness to the violence or eventually be captured by a German police officer. The game progresses similarly to the original version: each turn, game events are calculated and resolved by the system without requiring the player to make decisions. The game ends if the player dies or if the police meet their quota of expelling six Jewish citizens.

**The subversion**
This module rearticulates the residual information of the victims with the purpose of humanizing them. Here, the player can learn about the story and fate of each Jewish prisoner, something impossible in the analog version. In this way, the module enables the emergence of small stories that narrate events of violence from a counterhegemonic perspective.

On a technical level, the work has involved gathering and reorganizing the system's residual information and creating an appropriate interface for its presentation. In line with the rhetorical objectives of this exercise, the game maintains a minimalist style, focusing the player’s attention on the unfolding story.
#### Investigation mode

**Rhetorical objective**
To expose the complicity of players in articulating hate rhetoric through gameplay.

**Theme**
The agency of players as they interact with artifacts of hate propaganda.

**Objective of the artifact**
To generate resources for critical work with the original material.

**Components**
This module is also available in a web format. A mouse or touchpad is required in order to play.

This artifact generates text documents that record the actions occurring during a simulation:

``[gamestate 2:1:36] The game has started.

``Turn 1: No events this turn.
``Turn 2: A Jew has been kidnapped at Jacob's store by Police 2. Code J-2-2 has been assigned by the system.``
``Turn 2: A Jew has been kidnapped at Gorstein's store by Police 3. Code G-2-3 has been assigned by the system.``
``Turn 2: A Jew has been kidnapped at Herz's store by Police 6. Code H-2-6 has been assigned by the system.``
``Turn 3: A Jew has been kidnapped at David's store by Police 2. Code D-3-2 has been assigned by the system.``
``Turn 3: A Jew has been kidnapped at David's store by Police 1. Code D-3-1 has been assigned by the system.

*Fig 15. Investigation mode.*

**Gameplay**
This module is not exactly a game but rather a memory machine. Users have only one available option: "RUN A SIMULATION." Activating this button automatically resolves a session and downloads two documents for the player. The first document is a detailed log of the activity that occurred during the simulation, formatted as a report; each process and its outcomes are listed chronologically. The second document is a compilation of testimonies from each of the Jewish citizens involved in the simulation. Although the player has not interacted with any of these entities, their stories are there to be consulted.

**The Subversive Element**
This module demonstrates the functioning of *Juden Raus!*’s algorithmic structure and its effects; each simulation evidences the hate embedded in the game. Moreover, it reveals the players' relationship with this apparatus of hate: those who play *Juden Raus!* do not act as independent agents but as automatons serving the discourse. Thus, the critical proposal of this module is not limited to the original version of *Juden Raus!* but extends to all board games that perpetuate hate rhetoric: by consuming and spreading these artifacts, it is you who is being used—not the other way around.
## 5.2.5. Case presentation
### Forum review
In this section, I present the academic forums in which I have participated with *Juden Raus!*. These brief reviews describe the expectations and conditions established by each forum, allowing me to explain the rhetorical strategy I use to present the game in these spaces.
#### Spring Seminar
The first presentation of *Juden Raus!* took place at a European academic forum, specifically at Tampere University in Finland. I prepared a subverted version of the game for the Spring Seminar [2] organized by the university's *Game Research Lab*. After being evaluated by a jury, I presented the exercise results in a talk titled "Unraveling the Residual: Critical Metagames as Tools to Reveal and Challenge Ideologies in Board Games" (Castro Valdez, 2024).

[2]: The *Spring Seminar* is an academic outreach and discussion space specialized in games that fosters and values research innovation.

This forum adheres to the rules of Tampere University and has its own ethical and conduct codes, fostering diversity and participant safety. One established etiquette rule requires presenters to provide advance notice of any violent or disturbing content. This consideration was taken into account when presenting the talk and the game’s content.

The audience at this forum did not need convincing of the importance of studying games as propaganda artifacts; in fact, this space has been advancing game research since the establishment of game studies as a discipline. Rather, my rhetorical effort focused on demonstrating the value of the counterforensic approach for researching material culture in general, and games in particular.

During the presentation, I acted as an active interpreter of the subverted game: I presented screenshots, explained its mechanics, and showcased its results. Although I created a playable version for this event, there was no opportunity to demonstrate it live, so its presentation was limited to the documentation provided.
#### DiGRA Spain
The Spanish Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA Spain) has organized the 3rd International DiGRA Spain Congress 2024 (DIGRAES24) for November of this year [3]. DiGRA Spain is part of DiGRA, an "international association for academics researching digital games and associated phenomena." DiGRA Spain adheres to the conduct code of this organization (Digital Games Research Association, n.d.), which is available on their website. I reviewed this code to find references concerning the handling of difficult knowledge, which helped me understand the established conditions for this forum and guide my presentation. Under "Fostering Safer Spaces," point 2 of the code of conduct states:

>All members of the community are responsible for fostering inclusion: In addition to not using sexist, racist, heterosexist, cissexist, ableist, classist, casteist, or otherwise derogatory language, this means being open to accepting and processing criticism in a non-defensive manner. It also includes community accountability in recognizing where harms have been done and seeking to promote a collegial environment for all.

Additionally, point 5 under "Toward Better Practices" states:

>Be very careful when referencing or drawing on content created by hateful movements that you do not open new avenues for those movements to target and harass game studies scholars.

[3]: https://www.digraes24.es/

I submitted a talk titled "A Counterforensic Approach to Reconstruct Histories of Political Violence in Board Games" as part of the "Interdisciplinarity and Research Methods" track. In this work, I outline the foundations and procedures of counterforensic ludology, presenting *Juden Raus!* as a case study. The talk has been selected, and my presentation will take place on November 13, 2024.

As in the Spring Seminar, no space has been allocated for project demonstrations at this event, so I will once again serve as an interpreter for *Juden Raus!* to provide evidence that violent games can be subverted and transformed into critical mnemotechnic artifacts.
#### Thesis Dissertation
The third presentation of the game occurs within the context of defending my thesis at Tampere University. This is also an academic forum specialized in game studies and game culture, where *Juden Raus!* appears as part of an argument about the potential of the counterforensic approach to critique board games.

In this case, for the validity of the research, the game will be available for consultation by those responsible for reviewing this work. For this reason, the version of *Juden Raus!* presented in this forum adheres to the ethical standards required by the university.
