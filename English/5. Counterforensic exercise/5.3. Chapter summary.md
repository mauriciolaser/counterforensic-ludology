In this chapter, I have presented the counterforensic exercise I conducted with *Juden Raus!*. In the first subchapter, I explained my choice of reflective digitization as a research method because it facilitates the exploration of unknown unknowns and allows for an in-depth analysis of its violence scenarios without exposing myself to disturbing content. I established three rules for this process: maintaining the original algorithmic structure of the game, omitting racist representations and hate symbols, and avoiding the introduction of fictional elements. Additionally, I selected Construct 3 as a digitization tool due to its capacity to translate simulation models into digital format and because it facilitates rapid prototyping and experimentation.

In the second subchapter, I presented the counterforensic exercise conducted with *Juden Raus!*. First, I described the reflective digitization process applied to the game, which resulted in two versions, *Alpha* and *MVP*. These versions facilitate research tasks and generate insights into the rhetorical operations of the original game. Through this process, I identified two main rhetorical elements: the rhetoric of the proliferation of the “other” and the rhetoric of player agency. The first concerns the exaggerated representation of Jews in the fictional world, portrayed as constant and uncontrolled threats to German economy and society. The second rhetoric is reflected in the lack of meaningful choices for the player, who merely performs automatic actions such as rolling the dice and moving pieces. This creates an illusory agency, as the player participates in acts of violence without real control, becoming a passive accomplice to the game’s narrative of hate.

In the final part, I explained the development process of *Revisited*. This intervened version of the game allows players to understand the perspective of the victims and to generate data and documents that challenge the hate-driven rhetoric of the original game. Finally, I discussed my participation with this project in various academic forums, demonstrating the effectiveness of counterforensic ludology in analyzing and subverting problematic board games.
