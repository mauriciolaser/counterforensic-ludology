## 5.1.1. Reflexive digitization and the counterforensic
Reflexive digitization offers methodological, ethical, and safety advantages for counterforensic work. Methodologically, it facilitates the reconstruction of residual information generated by the game system, which has proven useful in tracking simulated violence. Additionally, reflexive digitization simplifies experimentation tasks, enabling a deeper analysis of violent scenarios. Finally, this methodology generates knowledge and tools that support critical intervention with the original material.

In terms of practitioner safety, digitization allows them to examine problematic objects on their own terms, without the need to consume disturbing content or engage in roles or activities that symbolize violent acts.
## 5.1.2. Digitization rules
I established three rules for the digitization process of this project:

⦁	The digitized game retains the original algorithmic structure: its rules are identical to the original, and its mechanics derive from these rules.
⦁	If the original game includes racist representations or hate symbols, these are not included in the digitized version.
⦁	No new entities or fictional elements are introduced in the game. Only the retrieval, reconfiguration, and use of the game’s residual information are permitted.

## 5.1.3. Digitization tools
The tool I use to digitize board games is Construct 3 (Construct, n.d.), a web-based authoring game engine with which I have experience digitizing board games. I chose Construct 3 because it meets two criteria: it allows for translating simulation models and enables conducting and evaluating experiments. The event and entity system in Construct 3 facilitates the representation of the game’s algorithmic structure, simplifying the translation of the simulation model into digital format. Additionally, Construct 3’s debugger supports in-depth examination of the game model and the conduction of experiments with it.
