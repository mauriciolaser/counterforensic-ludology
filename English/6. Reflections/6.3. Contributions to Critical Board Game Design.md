Counterforensic ludology is part of the tradition of critical and political art and design work that subverts material culture; specifically, work that disrupts the functioning of objects and uses their own expressive mechanisms against them. Subversion is a political and aesthetic act that challenges the ideological operations embedded in any object and is not limited to a specific type of rhetoric. Rather, it addresses all rhetorics that legitimize power, domination, and violence. Counterforensic ludology situates this subversive practice in the specific context of violence exerted by state entities against their own citizens. In this sense, this approach resonates with resistance practices in dominated societies that oppose hegemonic discourses legitimizing their domination, and it challenges the established traditions of board game design.

Next, I present two contributions of counterforensic ludology to the critical design of analog board games. Both contributions aim to subvert state violence discourses in analog board games, though they can also be integrated into design practices that seek to subvert board games more generally [Z]. 

[Z]: It is important to make this distinction since, although analog and digital board games are based on the same game model, digital systems offer advantages for working with game-generated information. 
## 6.3.1. Integrating Residues into Critical Work with Analog Board Games
We know that board games, as systemic forms of material culture, produce residues that reveal the ideological tensions inherent in the game. Designers, in deciding what information from the game system is presented to players and how it is displayed, determine the dominant text generated by the game. As we have pointed out, this process relegates information about game entities and events to the residual plane, beyond the player's threshold of detectability. In this sense, residues are a fundamental input for questioning the game’s power operations and rhetorical objectives.

There is a close relationship between critical game design practices and working with residues. *Reverse engineering* is an established game design and hacking practice in which designers and hackers disassemble programs that contain digital games to gather information about the system, either to exploit it or simply to deepen their understanding. Among the information collected, residues—those housed, produced, and processed by the system but not utilized—often capture the interest of player and designer communities [Y]. For example, through reverse engineering, practitioners discovered that in *NES Remix* (Nintendo, 2013) for the Nintendo Wii U console, the title screen for *Super Mario Bros.* was built over an image of the Mona Lisa. This is likely due to the team responsible for this menu having previously worked on *Nintendo 3DS Guide: Louvre* (Nintendo, 2013).

Residues can tell us multiple stories about the state of the gaming industry and video game creation practices. They can also reveal uncomfortable truths about Nintendo’s design and production philosophy, challenging their narrative of “attention to detail.” From the perspective of this thesis, reverse engineering is a practice that acknowledges forensic aesthetics and materiality; its practitioners act as mediators of these objects in various forums, whether technical or fan-based.

[Y]: The blogs Super Mario Broth (n.d.) and The Cutting Room Floor (n.d.) are examples of communities dedicated to exploring and discussing residues extracted from popular digital game files.

How, then, does reverse engineering work in a board game? When the board game is in digital format, it is possible to break down the program using established techniques to access information about the system. However, in analog games, this process requires additional steps. In this thesis, I have demonstrated that it is possible to recover residues from the game system through research-through-design techniques, such as reflexive digitization. By transferring *Juden Raus!* to a digital format, I captured information about game entities that, in the analog version, was outside the threshold of detectability and used it to create *Juden Raus! Revisited*, a critical artifact.

The use of reflexive digitization as a research technique has been valuable, but the guiding principle behind my work has been the forensic perspective. Although this forensic perspective is already present in the cultures of video game designers and hackers, I believe it can be integrated into the people and communities that work with analog board games.
## 6.3.2. Constructing Subaltern Narratives from Board Games
Designers and artists have used residues as inputs for game critique. For this thesis, I reviewed the work of the guerrilla design team Total Refusal, who “upcycle video games in order to reveal the political apparatus beyond the glossy and hyperreal textures of this media” (n.d.). The work of Total Refusal is a clear example of using residues from a digital game to challenge the game’s discursive projects. Leonhard Müllner, one of the members of this collective, has presented "Bot-Appropriation" as an artistic and critical practice that involves intervening, appropriating, or manipulating the programmed behaviors and routines of NPCs (Non-Playable Characters) within digital games. Through this practice, artists deviate NPCs from their predefined programming to reveal the social, narrative, or ideological structures these characters represent within the game’s logic (Müller, 2022). The short film *Hardly Working* (Total Refusal [Flock, Stumpf, Klengel, & Müllner], n.d.) uses the algorithmic and representational structure of *Red Dead Redemption 2* (Rockstar Games, 2018) to create a narrative focused on NPCs. By using residues from the game as part of a narrative inquiry exercise, Total Refusal exploits the polyphony of the original game and builds a critical artifact that exposes how labor is represented in games created by major industry players.

Performing this exercise with analog board games is difficult, though not impossible. The characteristics of the medium and the design traditions governing its construction limit designers' access to the voice of the dominated. There is a practical barrier to accessing information on subaltern actors in board games, as this information is often lost due to analog games’ limited processing, recording, and storage capabilities. Furthermore, due to board game design traditions—even in those that simulate wars—violence is abstracted so as not to “disturb players” (Train & Ruhnke, 2016) and to allow for the discursive unfolding of the game, as seen in cases like *Afrikan Tähti* (Mannerla, 1951; Harrer & Harviainen, 2022) or *Santa Maria* (Aporta Games, 2017; Sedelmeir & Baum, 2022). Counterforensic ludology integrates experimental game research methodologies, such as narrative inquiry and reflexive digitization, to reconstruct the subaltern texts of the game.

In this work, I have used reflexive digitization as a tool to reconstruct residues about the simulation of violence in the game, and I have employed narrative inquiry as a method to recover the game’s subaltern texts. The result of this exercise has been a network of critical artifacts that challenge the dominant texts produced in board games in relation to state violence, exposing the victims’ stories.

In conclusion, I believe that the counterforensic approach can drive critical game design by providing creators and activists with a starting point for exercises aimed at subverting the ideological projects of games, especially those addressing the simulation of state violence. Furthermore, this practice has the potential to strengthen the development of critical thinking in game designers.
