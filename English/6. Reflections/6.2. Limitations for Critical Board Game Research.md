## 6.2.1. "This Practice Overlooks the Act of Playing"
As a research approach, counterforensic ludology views the board game as a systemic artifact, focusing on its algorithmic structure. From the procedural perspective in which this practice is situated, the meaning-making process of games occurs when players’ mental models are engaged by the game’s models. Previously, this procedural view of games has been criticized for abstracting and even ignoring player performance (Sicart, 2011). From a play-centric perspective, understanding the expression of games requires considering the meaning-making process that occurs during play.

However, as I explained in section 2.3, my procedural view of board games is complemented by the representational and performance layers of the game. As part of the analysis of a board game during counterforensic practice, its representational elements (theme, storyline, visual and material representations) and performance elements (usability, potential experiences enabled by gameplay) are reviewed to understand the holistic and multimodal way in which the game’s ideology is expressed.
## 6.2.2. "Is this research, or is it a speculative exercise?"
The counterforensic approach I present in this thesis intersects with the philosophical tradition known as object-oriented ontology or speculative realism, in that it acknowledges a material aesthetics of objects not centered on humans, and a forensic aesthetics where humans act as agents operating within the same hierarchy as objects (Harman, 2015). From the perspective presented in this work, objects are entities that function as "sensors that register changes in their environments" (Weizman, 2020, p. 138) and "take agency through their interpretation, speaking by virtue of their 'friends'—those people who gather around them and construct them" (Keenan & Weizman, 2015, p. 43).

The "ludological" component of this approach, responsible for analyzing the original material, focuses on unraveling the structure and functioning of the game’s algorithmic structure, as in other exercises of formal analysis. What characterizes the counterforensic approach is its recognition that close reading of a game may be insufficient to understand what lies below the threshold of detectability, and it complements this with residual information, recovered through experimental techniques such as digitization. The *MVP* and *Alpha* versions of *Juden Raus!* preserve the game’s original algorithmic structure, its constitutive rules, but amplify our understanding of the game’s dynamics by bringing to light residual information the game system generates about state violence.

On the other hand, subversive exercises with games indeed have a speculative and interpretive component. In the case of *Juden Raus! Revisited*, the game contains the algorithmic structure of the original game and only uses information provided by the system, yet it speculates about the victim’s perspective, which was originally disarticulated and scattered as residuals. To subvert the dominant discourses of the game and its rhetorical operations, my work has involved reconfiguring the game system’s data to reconstruct the trajectory of the victims and allow them to tell their truth in the first person.
