## 6.1.1. The Forensic and the Power Operations of Games
Counterforensic ludology recognizes the forensic aesthetics and materiality of board game components and leverages these qualities to enhance critical game analysis. As I explained in sections 2.4 and 3.3, forensic aesthetics involve recognizing the sensory and expressive capabilities of objects. From this perspective, all objects perceive and interact with other objects in their environment without the need for human mediation, recording these encounters in their materiality. People, like other objects, can infer and interpret this information recorded by objects. This, in turn, allows objects to "express themselves" in various forums through expert mediators (Keenan & Weizman, 2015, p. 44). Secondly, forensic materiality refers to the uniqueness of objects. Building on forensic aesthetics, we recognize each object as unique, given its specific characteristics and relationships at a particular moment (Jones, 2022).

Applying these principles to board game systems [1], we approach each game entity as a unique object capable of perceiving and recording information about other objects through properties and relationships. As demonstrated in the *Juden Raus!* exercise, each "prisoner" in the game possesses properties and relationships that make them unique within the game system. At the beginning of the game, each prisoner occupies a specific position on the board and has a range of possible states: "alive or disappeared," "free or captured," among others. Additionally, prisoners have relationships with other entities; for example, with the "police" who pursue them or the "buildings" where they are captured.

``[14:55:04 Turn 2] Citizen 1 was abducted by Policeman 1``
``[19:58:15 Turn 3] Citizen 1 was moved from slot 3 to slot 6 by Policeman 1``
*In the MVP version, we see that a prisoner changes their state between turns in a game session that remained inactive for a few hours.*

[1]: This does not exclude the possibility of leveraging the forensic aesthetics and materiality of game components to conduct research that is not centered on game systems. For instance, in sports analysis, information about game objects—such as the ball or playing field—is used to analyze player behavior during a match.

The recognition of forensic aesthetics and materiality contributes to the critical analysis of games by providing evidence to expose the power operations within the game system. The game system exerts power when it suppresses information about the game's state to ensure the proper deployment of its dominant discourse. Concealing information is a fundamental part of all game design exercises; in fact, some games are built around gameplay that consists of hiding and recalling information. Similarly, there is information about game entities and systems that designers consider irrelevant to the functioning and enjoyment of the game.

*Fig 15. In That's not a Hat (Lapp, 2023), the goal of the game is to remember the illustrations on the cards. When a card is drawn, it is shown and then kept face down (Source: Amazon, n.d.).*

However, when the board game in question is an artifact created with explicit rhetorical purposes—propaganda games, educational games, serious games—the information that is omitted becomes essential for understanding the game's rhetorical mechanisms. In this sense, the counterforensic exercise with games reveals how the game rejects this information and allows us to assess the intentions behind this omission, linking them to the game's rhetorical premises.
## 6.1.2. The Residual and the Subaltern Texts
The entities involved in a simulation record information about the state of the system and its components. However, only a small portion of that information—the dominant information—is used to inform players' gameplay and emotional experience. I refer to the web of information that the game generates but keeps inactive as residual information. Residual information is crucial for the critical study of board games not only because it reveals the game’s power operations (see previous point) but also because it allows for the reconstruction of the state and trajectory of all those entities (simulation actors) that occupy a subaltern role within the game system, as well as within the discourses it articulates. For example, in the exercise with *Juden Raus!*, I used residual information from the game system to reconstruct detailed reports of all acts of violence committed against the prisoners:

⦁	Exact time of the act of violence in the real world.
⦁	Exact time of the act of violence on the game’s clock.
⦁	Player responsible for the act of violence.
⦁	Police officer responsible for the act of violence.
⦁	Last name of the person subjected to violence.
⦁	Last names of the witnesses of the person subjected to violence.
⦁	Street where the act of violence took place.

But the residual not only allows us to reconstruct the state and trajectory of game entities; it also enables us to imagine these entities' experiences. In section 3.3, I introduced narrative inquiry as a speculative methodology that investigates games from the perspective of their objects. This type of speculative methodology uses information from the game model and its components to articulate texts voiced from the perspective of the entities. Consider the case of players who are in jail in *Monopoly*; the residual information from the system allows us to learn a bit more about the player-prisoner:

⦁	The reason they went to jail.
⦁	What they last did before going to jail.
⦁	How many times they have been in jail.
⦁	How many people have visited them in jail.
⦁	Who has visited them in jail.
⦁	With whom they shared a cell.
⦁	How much money they lost while in jail.
⦁	How many times they have tried to get out of jail.

By conducting narrative inquiry on this player using residual information, we can speculate about their experience in jail and allow them to express themselves in the first person:

`I'm here since turn 9. It's my first time in jail. I ended up here because I had bad luck. No one has visited me yet, but I share a cell with the Dog. During my time in jail, I’ve had tenants, but none have paid me. If I weren't here, I would have collected at least 300 [2]. This is my third attempt to get out, but I haven’t succeeded.

[2]: A personal discovery has been learning that the currency in *Monopoly* is called "Munny" (Monopoly Wiki, n.d.). 

Counterforensic ludology works with the residual information of games that model state violence to reconstruct the trajectories and testimonies of victims within the simulation. I have demonstrated in the exercise with *Juden Raus!* that working with the residual information of the game’s entities and units made it possible to recover the voices of subaltern actors who are (under)represented in the game: Jewish citizens who were subjected to violence are no longer racially stereotyped hats but rather actors with their own history.

For this reason, I consider these subaltern texts, which emerge from working with the residual, to be valuable resources for researching representation in board games, as they allow us to access the voices and perspectives of subaltern actors (victimized individuals) and integrate them into the game’s critical analysis.
