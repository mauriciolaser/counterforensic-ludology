In this chapter, I presented my reflections on the counterforensic ludology exercise with *Juden Raus!* and the contributions and limitations of this approach for the critical study and design of board games.

In the first subchapter, I explained that counterforensic ludology enables, from a research perspective, the exposure of power operations in board games, which occur when design mechanisms are used to suppress and omit information about dominated groups. By recovering the game’s residual information, it becomes possible to reconstruct the operations that generated and suppressed this information. I also noted that this approach allows for the construction of networks of residual signifiers as subaltern texts of games, providing access to the perspective of entities dominated by the game's ideological apparatus.

In the second subchapter, I addressed two limitations mentioned during the presentation of this project. The first, the abstraction of the player, refers to players being considered in abstract terms within the analysis exercises. I explained that this is addressed by complementing the analysis of the game system with a review of the representational and performative layers. The second limitation, the speculative component of the analysis, is mitigated by using the game’s original algorithmic structure. This ensures that the "subverted" versions of the game are built on the procedural logic of the original material.

In the third subchapter, I presented two contributions of counterforensic ludology to critical board game design. The first contribution is demonstrating that it is possible to retrieve and use residual information from analog board games. This process is slowed and limited by the inherent capacities of analog board games; therefore, I noted the benefits of digitization as a way to facilitate research tasks. The second contribution is enabling the emergence of subaltern texts centered on the victims, with the potential to contest the games’ hegemonic narratives. This practice is typically restricted to digital games, but I presented a concrete case where the residual information from a board game can be used for a speculative exercise centered on the subjects dominated within the game’s model.

Finally, I outlined two lines of work that stem from this project. The first is political and involves the activation of forums. I explained that counterforensic work should aim to participate in all forums where the truth about state violence is contested. Furthermore, I noted that if such spaces do not exist, it is necessary to build networks with other actors interested in game subversion to create new forums. The second line of work is more local and relates to pedagogies for critical game design in general, and board game design in particular. I explained that Latin America has a tradition of game subversion and critical pedagogies aimed at liberating oppressed subjects. However, despite the growing availability of game design programs, curricula do not reflect this knowledge. In this regard, counterforensic ludology can contribute to building a critical pedagogy for game design in the region.
