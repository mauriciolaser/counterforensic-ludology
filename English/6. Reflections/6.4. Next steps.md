Finally, considering the advantages of counterforensic ludology for critical work with board games, I present two lines of work that emerge from this project.
## 6.4.1. To Activate Forums
The first line of work is the intervention and activation of forums where state violence is legitimized. The counterforensic device is political by design. This theoretical and practical exploration arises from the need to understand and challenge how discourses of violence are conveyed in board games. This challenge occurs "internally" within the intervened games: the algorithm is manipulated to subvert the game's rhetoric. However, this challenge must necessarily be transferred to forums where state violence is legitimized, that is, to the ideological apparatuses of the State, such as schools, media, public institutions, the State itself, museums, and others. The work of subverting games like *Juden Raus!* is not complete until new discourses emerge among players that question state violence, whether in academic (research), pedagogical (learning sessions), or political (petitions) contexts.

In this sense, the next step of this project is to identify and activate forums where *Juden Raus! Revisited* can resonate with viewers and creators interested in critical work on state violence.
## 6.4.2. Contributing to Pedagogies for Critical Game Design
Throughout this thesis, I have shown how counterforensic ludology is framed within postcolonial critical traditions that study political violence and the subversion of cultural objects. In particular, in my region, Latin America, hacking, subverting, and reclaiming technologies, including games, has been an essential characteristic of the creative work of game designers in recent years (Penix-Tadsen, 2019; Wong, 2021). [W].

[W]: Situating this project in Latin America reflects my position as a Latino. This does not limit the possibility of replicating this practice in other contexts.

I would like to highlight a third critical tradition relevant to critical game design: the pedagogy of the oppressed, a form of critical pedagogy developed by educator Paulo Freire (Freire, 1992). This pedagogy seeks to create spaces for teaching and learning where students develop tools to understand and question their own sociocultural and political structures, with the goal of transforming them toward the common good. In Latin America, Freireâ€™s ideas have influenced the creation of educational projects and the development of liberating pedagogies. Nevertheless, despite the growth of game design programs in the region in recent years, the limited presence of these critical pedagogies in their curricula is notable (Cibertec, 2024; Toulouse Lautrec, 2024). [M]

[M]: A systematic review of these programs is still pending; however, based on my experience in the community of game design educators in Peru, I can confirm the still incipient reach of the critical and ethical perspective in the curricula aimed at training future game designers.

What is the potential of counterforensic ludology to foster the development of critical thinking in game designers? Creating a game from this perspective requires knowledge in sociology and history, as well as systemic thinking skills. Additionally, it requires establishing safety frameworks to protect creators exposed to complex content and ethical frameworks to manage the creation of such content. It is also necessary to validate the work with the communities represented in the games. All of this implies developing critical thinking skills in game designers. In this sense, I believe that counterforensic ludology can be integrated both into the training processes of game designers and into those that use game design as a learning methodology.
