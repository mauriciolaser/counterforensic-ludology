This final chapter contains my reflections on the contributions and limitations of counterforensic practice for research and critical intervention in board games, in light of the exercise conducted with *Juden Raus!*. These reflections incorporate comments and observations from researchers and players who have become familiar with this approach following my participation in colloquia and the thesis seminar.
