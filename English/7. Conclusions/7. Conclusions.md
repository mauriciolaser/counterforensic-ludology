In this project, I have explored how board games circulate discourses that legitimize state violence through their models. My literature review revealed that critical analysis of these games often focuses on their hegemonic discourses, neglecting the subaltern elements present in these games but hidden below the threshold of detectability for players and analysts. In critical digital game design, these residual elements have been addressed to subvert the ideological projects of the original games, but such work is still scarce with board games.

In response to this context, the objective of my thesis has been to explore ways to examine and question hegemonic discourses in board games, specifically those that legitimize state violence against civilian populations. To this end, I introduced counterforensic ludology as a critical approach for studying and subverting these games. This approach examines and challenges representations of state violence in board games and is rooted in the tradition of resistance and subversion of thinkers and designers from postcolonial countries. In this work, I present the theoretical, practical, and political foundations of this practice, as well as procedures for carrying it out while ensuring practitioners’ safety.

To demonstrate the benefits of this practice, I conducted a counterforensic exercise with the game *Juden Raus!*. This exercise showed that incorporating a counterforensic perspective into game studies makes it possible to expose the power operations within games that suppress subaltern voices. It also demonstrated that these voices can be recovered using object-oriented research techniques, such as narrative inquiry and reflexive digitization, which I explain in the appendix of this work. Through the collection and analysis of residues from the game, I was able to reconstruct the trajectories and experiences of underrepresented characters, giving voice to those who were originally silenced.

The creation of *Juden Raus! Revisited* was a crucial step in this process. This version of the game, developed for the thesis project, uses the original game’s residues to articulate counterhegemonic narratives that challenge its own rhetorical frameworks. By reconfiguring the game from the perspective of the victims, I sought to subvert its hegemonic discourse and foster critical reflection on state violence and its representation in games.

Based on the project results, I identify the contributions of this practice to game research and critical design, namely, that it exposes the internal power operations within games, enables the articulation of subaltern texts centered on victims, and facilitates critical practices in board games using residues.

Finally, I propose two next steps for this project. First, to participate in and intervene in forums with this project, especially those that circulate discourses legitimizing state violence against civilian populations. Second, to explore the integration of counterforensic ludology into emerging game design pedagogies, which currently lack components aimed at developing critical thinking.

In conclusion, counterforensic ludology is a powerful tool for analyzing and questioning hegemonic discourses in board games that legitimize state violence, allowing for the recovery and amplification of voices that have been silenced.
