In this appendix, I present *reflexive digitization* as an experimental research method for investigating board game design. First, I introduce the concepts and definitions I use to frame this practice. Then, I present reflexive digitization as an experimental method and detail its procedures.
## Concepts and definitions
I begin this section by clarifying the concepts of *game design*, *game design research*, and *experimental game design research*, which are fundamental to the practice of reflexive digitization.

In this thesis, I refer to game design as a representation of the form and function of a ludic artifact constructed under specific ideals, conventions, and technologies. Game design encompasses more than the descriptions, data structures, and operational schemes that designers may create to explain how a game behaves or should behave; this can be expressed in a game design document (GDD), a voice message, a patent, or a diagram on a whiteboard. Sometimes, a single game element is enough to evoke the entire design of a game: *“I loved this mechanic! What a great game design”.*

In this work, games are approached as designed systemic artifacts, and game design research is the study of game design. Game design research has been defined as a practice aimed at “to uncover new facts and insight about game design, design processes, or games as designed objects; that is, to gain new knowledge and understanding about game design” (Lankoski & Holopainen, 2017, p. 1). One way to conduct game design research is through design itself, known as experimental game design research, which is “a way to, through designing, understand more about design principles for games” (Waern & Back, 2015, p. 341). This perspective has also been presented as game research through design:

> Research through design, on the other hand, is an approach to produce different kinds of design knowledge, including conceptual frameworks and design theories. As the name implies the outputs are developed through actively engaging in producing designed artifacts. (Lankoski & Holopainen, 2017, p. 2).

Research through design is an approach that employs design theory and practices as methods for academic inquiry (Zimmerman, Stolterman, & Forlizzi, 2010, p.1). The logic is that, when a practitioner constructs or reconstructs an artifact during a design process, they acquire knowledge and develop skills that allow them to understand the design of the artifact in question more deeply (Zimmerman, Forlizzi, & Evenson, 2007). When these design processes are conducted rigorously and reflectively, they produce knowledge about the designed artifact and its epistemological field, which can be used for academic purposes.

This approach has three aspects that benefit research. The first is that it allows for the exploration of *unknown unknowns*, which are aspects of objects that are not evident a priori, either because they are deeply embedded in their components or because they have not previously been addressed in a research field (Recker, 2015, p.4). Second, a research through design process results in a concrete artifact that embodies the knowledge generated during the design process. This artifact can also be analyzed and scrutinized by the scientific community to replicate and validate the knowledge it contributes. Finally, research through design produces *knowledge objects* such as diaries, code, and design documents that can be used as inputs for studying the object (Zimmerman, Stolterman, & Forlizzi, 2010, p.310). These materials enrich research by providing traceability of the thinking and decisions made during the design process, allowing other researchers to analyze, replicate, and validate the knowledge generated.

Research through design also faces limitations that hinder its consolidation as a robust research paradigm. One of the main barriers is an idealized view of design held by practitioners, which distances it from a rigorous and systematic approach, as it is not considered a “rational” or “logical” process. Likewise, standardizing documentation of the process is crucial to enable the formalization of theories, as it facilitates tracking how the framing of problems and proposed solutions evolve throughout the project. Added to this is the scarcity of examples and critical analyses, as well as the need for more publication venues and increased financial support for this type of experimental research (Zimmerman, Stolterman, & Forlizzi, 2010, p.316).

Board game research through design is the application of the research through design approach to the academic field of board games; namely, investigating board game design through the active practice of game design (Hook & Coulton, 2017, p.99). Although in the literature review for this thesis I did not find exact references to the term "board game research through design," there are mentions of this approach in the context of digital games (Lankoski & Holopainen, 2017, pp.2, 158). This suggests that, although the specific concept for board games is not formally established, the fundamental principles of research through design can be effectively adapted and applied in this field. Therefore, I define *board game research through design* as an **experimental practice that enables researchers to gain an in-depth understanding of their object of study, produce documentation of the research knowledge acquired, explore unknown unknowns, and construct critical artifacts** (Zimmerman, Stolterman, & Forlizzi, 2010, p.1; Lankoski & Holopainen, 2017, p.2; Jones, Liapis, Lykourentzou, & Guido, 2017).
## Reflexive board game digitization as research
In this section, I introduce reflexive digitization as an experimental practice in board game design research. I begin by framing board game digitization as an established practice in game design. I then explain the need for this practice, followed by a discussion of its foundations, benefits, and limitations. Finally, I detail its procedures, basing my approach on reflections from my own experience with reflexive digitization and an exploratory literature review.
### Board game digitization
In technical language, digitization refers to the “transformation of the analog into discrete data, that is, values within a system of values clearly distinguishable from one another” (Koch, 2017, p.1). From a computational and ethnographic perspective, digitization is defined as the cultural practice of encoding culture through informational digital objects such as hardware or software. To digitize is to translate an object that is presented in the world as an integrated entity—a landscape—into another object that represents the first—a photograph of the landscape through a data structure that is interpreted by software and hardware.

Digitizing cultural artifacts offers significant advantages for their preservation, distribution, and practical use. Examples of cultural digitization include transforming a manuscript into an eBook, recording a folk song, or algorithmically representing the behavior of a group during a social event. At the same time, the digitization of cultural artifacts has two fundamental implications for the digitized object itself, as well as for its audience. The first implications relate to the embedded meaning of the transformed artifact. To digitize something, it is first necessary to interpret it and deduce its meaning within the culture. Thus, digitization, as a cultural practice, imprints the resulting cultural object with new signifiers tied to the ideas and values of the agents responsible for its transformation. As Koch explains:

>During the design process, the cultural is inscribed in the devices, programmes, and infrastructures, which – while they do not determine the use – set up a particular framework, although it is not immediately visible but works unnoticed and insistently. These cultural inscriptions in digital technologies can be made visible through analyses of the materiality of hard- and software (Koch, 2017, p. 4) (Koch, 2017, p.4). 

The second implication relates to the ecosystem of texts and interpreters where the digitized object is displayed. By converting a cultural artifact into digital technology, it amplifies its reach and connects with networks of actors and settings in which it is discussed and scrutinized:

>The unique attributes of digital media affect the whole process of recording, description, reconstruction, interpretation, deduction and dissemination of cultural heritage. (...) Digital technologies have divided the audience of cultural heritage, creating different ways of viewing, receiving and participating in the interaction. The cultural nature and content of cultural heritage are also understood in different ways. Different audiences also have different perceptions and interpretations of digital heritage, and these perceptions and interpretations also interact with each other (i.e. the intertextuality of heritage). Intertextuality brings more possibilities for the interpretation and interpretation of cultural heritage (Yin & Liu, 2022, p. 7).

Based on the above, we can affirm that the digitization of material culture involves transformations that affect the integrity and very essence of cultural objects, as well as the practices associated with their consumption.

Digitization is an established practice in the design and practical study of board games (Brathwaite & Schreiber, 2009, p. 59). In the context of this work, I define it as the cultural practice that partially or fully transforms an analog game into a digital artifact (Rogerson, Gibbs & Smith, 2015). This practice involves recording, describing, reconstructing, interpreting, deducing, and disseminating the source material in a new value system; namely, that of digital board games. Digitization dates back to the early days of the digital game industries. Games like *Solitaire* (Cherry, 1990) and *Mahjong* (Brodie Lockard, 1981) have been transformed from their analog format into computer programs on multiple occasions. In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that, by now, most plays of these originally analog games have taken place in front of a screen. Today, board game publishers adapt popular games like *Wingspan* (Monster Couch, 2021) or *Root* (Dire Wolf Digital, 2020) to the digital format. Board game designers continually digitize their own designs, facilitating their design and testing processes, as well as their distribution. It has been observed that digitization streamlines tasks related to design and testing of game concepts and prototypes (Rogerson, Sparrow & Gibbs, 2021), allowing designers to build design knowledge and learn about game design (Waern & Back, 2015, p. 158). This is also a long-standing practice among hobbyists and hackers, who adapt board games to digital formats to experiment with and play them to their liking.

Players engage with digitized or hybrid games differently than they do with their analog versions, transforming their practices of consumption and interpretation. Kankainen (2016) presents this activity of play as a holistic pastime that includes both digital and analog versions, enabling new points of contact between the player and the game:

>(...) it seems that playing *Blood Bowl* can be seen as holistic pastime, where material and digital aspects have different, although sometimes overlapping, roles. It can be understood as a collection of separate but interlinked activities i.e. as a pastime. In this case the pastime also contains playing the digital version, as it offers a way to practice tactics and offers the opportunity to play in different ways than with only material version of the game. (p. 6)

Rogerson, Gibbs, and Smith have observed the transformations that a game’s materiality undergoes when digitized in terms of loss. In this regard, the authors highlight the communicative role that game materials play in their analog version (Rogerson, Gibbs, & Smith, 2016, 2020) and warn that by reducing or eliminating the game’s housekeeping tasks (enforcing rules, recording game information), players lose opportunities for engagement with the game, which could limit their learning of its rules and mechanics.

For my project, I am interested in understanding the possibilities for play and game interpretation that are enabled when the game’s algorithmic components undergo transformations. In this sense, I reflectively value what is lost during digitization, but I focus on what emerges when the game is translated into a new medium.
### My needs as a practicioner
When researching board game design—especially those that address themes of political violence—I have identified safety and practical factors that limit my work.

The safety factor arises when analysis focuses on games that depict disturbing elements or situations. Analyzing a game involves playing it analytically to explore and define the space of possibilities it permits. In doing so, I must familiarize myself with its rules and theme, and, more importantly, apply the algorithm dictated by the designer (Galloway, 2006, p. 90), which may potentially entail interpreting problematic roles and situations. Unlike digital games, the functioning of a board game depends entirely on the player; this implies that the player must develop a close relationship with the rules, both in terms of understanding and in ensuring their correct application (Ambrosio & Ross, 2023, p. 4). For these reasons, it is important to recognize that when analyzing board games that model political violence, I am exposed—implicitly or explicitly—to representations of social trauma or *difficult knowledge* (Pitt & Britzman, 2003).

Regarding practical factors, these relate to the characteristics and behaviors of analog board games, especially those that model political violence. To analyze these games from a ludological perspective, I need to observe their entities and systems in action and be able to experiment with them to facilitate the emergence of procedural rhetoric. It is common for certain simulation scenarios to activate only when multiple factors converge, such as player decisions and luck. For example, in *Shining Path: The Struggle for Peru* (Train, 1999), it is difficult to meet the conditions to trigger the scenario where the United States invades Peru:

>War on Drugs: The Government Player may roll once without DRM penalty or added debt (but added Corruption) on both the Economic and Military columns of the Foreign Aid Table, or he may choose to have his EP or AP debt wiped out as above. The Government Player also immediately conducts a Purge of the organization with the highest Corruption Level and does not gain any further APs from the cocaine trade while this policy is in effect (but he does gain the Corruption, if he has any units operating in the Huallaga Valley). If, in the Random Events Phase of any turn this policy is in effect, Government Political Support is 30 or less, the Government player must roll 1d6 to check for US Military Intervention. If he rolls a 5 or 6, the United States invades Peru for its own good and the game ends immediately with a Sendero player victory (Train, 1999, p. 7).

In this sense, it is necessary to have tools that facilitate the examination of these scenarios during an investigative process.

Another practical factor relates to conducting game state logging tasks during play. Games include tools that allow for recording the state of entities and game components during gameplay, which operate manually. During analytical play, querying the game state and logging its changes are essential for understanding system behavior, but these tasks slow down play and affect player immersion. More importantly, the logging that the game itself performs is incomplete, focusing only on certain aspects of the game—the dominant ones. For example, in *Shining Path*, we observe that the provided logging tool omits the number of fallen units during play or the number of times the GOVERNMENT player has committed abuses against the civilian population. This omission serves a rhetorical function—to sanitize the acts of violence simulated in the game—and additionally hinders analysis of the game’s progress.

Thus, my critical practice requires an approach that, on the one hand, protects my mental health when exposed to *difficult knowledge* and, on the other, facilitates tools for examining and logging game systems without distorting the procedural rhetoric of games that model political violence.
### Defining reflexive digitization
Reflexive digitization is an experimental research practice in board game design research that uses digitization as a means to analyze the behavior of its components and systems and to generate resources that enable critical intervention. The logic is as follows: by digitizing a board game, I develop expert knowledge about its structure and forms of expression, and create tools that facilitate analysis and subsequent intervention. In design research, practices like reverse engineering respond to the questions: "what is this made of? how does this work?" Within these processes, researchers dismantle and reconstruct artifacts to examine in depth the characteristics and behaviors of their design (Kuys, Anderson, Jackson, & Melles, 2009). In board game design research, the questions are "what is this game made of? how does this game work?"

One aspect that distinguishes a process of reflexive digitization from any adaptation of board games to digital format is the reflection on the practice itself. Schön (2017) characterizes the *reflective practitioner* as someone who thinks critically and adaptively to address problematic situations that arise during the work process, analyzing their own experiences critically to improve their practice and learn more about their field. In an exercise of reflexive digitization, the knowledge developed through reconstructing the game is essential for achieving the objectives of critical research and intervention. By documenting this reflective process, I develop tools that can later be used to enrich other processes of analysis and design, whether in game production contexts, experimentation, or academic research.

Based on my experience, I observe that reflexive digitization meets the research needs identified in the previous section. First, this approach ensures my safety as a researcher by freeing me from exposure to descriptions and representations of violence. As I demonstrated in the exercise with *Juden Raus!*, digitization allows me to maintain a deep connection with the complex theme in a dispassionate way, without the obligation to perform roles. By digitizing a game, I gain a deep understanding of its algorithmic structure without the need to experience simulated violence scenarios. Even when gameplay testing is necessary, I can choose to present game components with descriptions and illustrations that are not problematic.

In terms of facilitating game examination, implementing it in a digital format allows for a detailed record of gameplay, including all player actions, generated events, and the state of game components. The game state, which in the analog version is an abstract entity, can be materialized in various ways to facilitate analysis. For example, in a *Chess* game in tabletop format, it is difficult for players to precisely remember the position of each pawn on every turn. In a digital version, the analyst can access information about each entity in real-time via the game log and then download it as a document. In the same vein, digitization facilitates experimentation with board games because it enables the setup of actual game scenarios where one can test and observe the behavior of the system and its components. As I have been outlining, reflexive digitization also generates tools derived from the original game, such as documents, or even technologies like modules, debuggers, or interfaces, which can be used not only for research but also for critical intervention with the game.

An additional benefit of reflexive digitization is that it enables the emergence of unknown unknowns, unexplored aspects of the original material that reveal themselves during the work process. By transferring board game entities to a new medium and language (the programming language of a game engine), the practitioner witnesses the emergence of new behaviors and properties of these entities. Galloway (2022), after reflecting on his own practice as a digitizer, has recognized that when digitizing a board game, "emergent mysteries" arise; namely, properties and behaviors of the game’s entities and systems that are only detectable when observed in a different environment:

> To win means to know the system. And thus to interpret a game means to interpret its algorithm (to discover its parallel “allegorithm”). (...) I suggest that video games are, at their structural core, in direct synchronization with the political realities of the informatic age. There really are things that you will never experience or never discover unless you have a tactitle or tangible or craft or production engagement with the material. (...) There are all sort sort of things that I wouldn't have discovered about the game simply by interrogating the historical record and looking at archives and reading his published work if I hadn't tried to restage the rules of the game in software. And in doing that it led to a whole bunch of things that emerged (Galloway, 2022).

One of these *emergent mysteries* is the residual information produced by the game system, which is a valuable resource for analysis and critical work, as I have explained in the body of the thesis (5.2).
### Procedures
Reflexive digitization involves a preliminary preparation process and two main processes: the reconstruction and deconstruction of the game. These processes are carried out iteratively until the research and design objectives established for the intervention are achieved. Below, I provide a brief description of these processes, based on my experience as a practitioner.
#### Preparation and analysis
The first step in reflexive digitization is to gain an in-depth understanding of the source material. This initially involves playing the game analytically, focusing on understanding how the game works rather than enjoying it (Mäyrä, 2008) [X]. Playing the board game analytically is essential for gaining an initial understanding of the game's design and observing its systemic functioning (Booth, 2021). This approach also informs research objectives and questions, prompting adjustments if necessary.

[X]: In some cases, this is not possible because the game is unavailable or because its content affects the researcher’s safety. 

The second step is the formal analysis of the game’s elements. For this process, I examine the game’s formal elements (Järvinen, 2008; Fernández-Vara, 2019), paying particular attention to those directly related to its algorithmic structure; namely, the rulebook, the charts and tables, the counters, and the board. In certain cases, it is also useful to examine these elements through the lens of game analysis and design models. For example, in preparing the digitization of *Shining Path*, a simulation game, I complemented my formal examination of game elements with the simulation game design model proposed by Volko Ruhnke (2022), which allowed me to understand the game in the terms defined by its designer. In my experience, this process involves creating a dictionary of all elements involved in the game, describing their properties, behaviors, and relationships with other elements.

The third step is constructing a "reverse engineered" design document. This document functions as a Game Design Document (GDD), a standard document in game design practice that “contains the design guidelines for a game.” As I mentioned earlier, designers create this document with the understanding that it is an ideal representation of the game’s design, useful for communicating design objectives to clients or the production team.

In my experience, this exercise allows me to gain a broad understanding of the game, which informs the reconstruction and experimentation process. Additionally, everything learned is recorded in analysis documents, research journals, diagrams, and other resources, which are essential for validating the results of the exercise.
#### Reconstruction
In design research, reconstruction is the process of implementing new versions of an object to analyze it and conduct experiments; additionally, reconstruction allows for re-creating the design process of its authors and interpreting their decisions during this process. In the specific case of board game digitization, this process involves implementing digital versions of the game or its subsystems.

From my experience, I can assert that this exercise produces at least two outcomes. The first is becoming an expert in the game, specifically in its simulation engine, which facilitates subsequent analysis tasks. From a proceduralist ludological perspective, the main area of interest in game research is understanding how the game functions systemically; that is, how its components relate and behave to create expression. In this sense, the aspect of board game design I focus on is its algorithmic structure. This algorithmic structure can be read and interpreted through different paradigms. In my case, working from a proceduralist paradigm, which addresses the procedural rhetorics of the game, I focus on the game's entities and units (Bogost, 2008; Lundblade, 2019). The second outcome is that it produces knowledge objects—code, development journals, documents, logs—that enable a critical intervention of the game.

To prepare for the reconstruction, I define the criteria and rules for conducting the process, as well as the characteristics of the resulting artifacts. For example:

⦁	Are the original rules kept intact?
⦁	What game processes should be automated?
⦁	What type of information should be recorded in the digital system?
⦁	How is the original game art translated into the digital version?

As I discussed in the previous section, digitization is a cultural practice that transforms the original object and imprints the values of its practitioner onto it. For this reason, it is important for the epistemological oversight of this experiment to document and justify each design decision made.

With the process objectives established, the next step is to choose a tool that facilitates this reconstruction process. In my case, I have chosen Construct 3 because it is a game development engine I am familiar with and provides tools, such as the event system and objects, that simplify the reconstruction of game models.

The final step is to iteratively create adapted versions of the original material. In my practice, this exercise has primarily aimed to explore the functioning of the game model and retrieve residual information—evidence—from the algorithmic representation of violence.
### Summary
In summary, reflexive digitization of board games meets my needs as a researcher by ensuring my safety and facilitating game analysis. This method allows me to gain deep knowledge of the original material without direct exposure to representations of violence. During the process, I generate knowledge objects such as code, design documents, and logs that enable informed critical intervention. Furthermore, digitization reveals residual information from the game system, providing valuable evidence for analyzing the game’s ideological tensions and recovering its subaltern voices, as demonstrated by the counterforensic exercise presented in this thesis.
