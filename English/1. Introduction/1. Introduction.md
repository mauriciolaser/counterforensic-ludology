Recently, alongside the rise of the commercial board game industry in the West, interest has grown within game studies and critical design to expose and question how these artifacts articulate hegemonic discourses that legitimize the exercise of violence by the dominant over the dominated. Academic work conducted for this purpose has established that certain board games legitimize domination and violence through representations of social and historical realities, subtly influencing how players construct their imaginaries about power.

However, this work is not yet complete. Artists and game designers have approached digital games from a critical perspective, subverting the original rhetoric of these games in favor of discourses centered on the victims of this violence, namely the dominated subjects. To achieve this, they have drawn on residues from game systems; that is, traces of violence produced through simulation but displaced by the games’ dominant structures below the players’ threshold of detectability. This has not occurred in the same way with board games.

My area of interest is even more specific: board games that allow players to commit acts of violence against civilian populations in the name of the State. I am particularly interested in addressing the systemic representation of state violence in board games that model social and historical realities. 

Like other cultural artifacts, games express ideological tensions, and their structures can either reinforce or conceal the ways in which violence is represented, sometimes portraying violent events indirectly or keeping them below the threshold of detectability.

This thesis reflects my effort to find ways to examine, expose, and question the representation of state violence in board games on my own terms and with my own tools: sociology, game design, and game research. I present counterforensic ludology as a critical practice that examines and subverts representations of violence in board games. By approaching board games from a counterforensic perspective, it becomes possible to identify, materialize, and present evidence of representations of state crimes. Ultimately, this counterforensic approach to games allows for the reconfiguration of the game itself, enabling new narratives about violence to emerge and challenging the game’s original meaning.

In the first chapter, I present the background of this work, framing games as systemic artifacts that express ideology and can be critically approached through analysis and intervention. In the second chapter, I introduce counterforensic ludology, explaining its background, foundations, and procedures. In the third chapter, I present Juden Raus!, the game I work with in this thesis, and in the fourth chapter, I describe the counterforensic exercise I conduct with the game. Finally, the last chapter contains my reflections on this process and ideas for the next steps in this project.
