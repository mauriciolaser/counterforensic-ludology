This chapter is divided into two parts, each with specific objectives. In the first subchapter, I explained the criteria for selecting *Juden Raus!* as the case study for this thesis. The established criteria were that the game model state violence and that this violence, along with the victims' perspective, be suppressed by the game system itself. *Juden Raus!* meets both requirements, as it models police violence against Jewish populations and, while it represents the victims, it does not give them a voice.

In the second subchapter, I provided an overview of *Juden Raus!*. First, I offered a historical account to familiarize the reader with the social reality represented in the game. I explained that in Nazi Germany, sports, games in general, and board games in particular were part of the regime's propaganda machinery, promoting rhetoric of hatred toward minorities. Then, I gave a general view of the game, detailing its components and basic mechanics. I also reviewed prior critical work on the game, highlighting that, while there are analyses from a historical perspective, these have not focused on its rules and mechanics. More importantly, the residual elements generated by the game and the subaltern texts it articulates have not been explored.

Likewise, I noted that no critical design work has been done with the game.
Based on these observations, I concluded the chapter by pointing out the need for a critical analysis of *Juden Raus!* from both analytical and subversive perspectives.
