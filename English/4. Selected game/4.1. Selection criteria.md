The purpose of counterforensic ludology is to reveal and subvert the rhetoric in board games that legitimizes state violence, promoting the emergence of narratives centered on victims and marginalized groups. As I explained in the background section, board games that model situations involving state violence often omit representations of civilian victims for ethical, commercial, and political reasons. Counterforensic ludology examines and intervenes in the algorithmic structure of these games to recover and expose evidence of the state violence simulated during gameplay. In this regard, the game selected for this exercise meets two conditions: it models state violence and suppresses the perspectives of civilian victims.
