That culture can be copied, that it is nothing but a copy, is merely a statement of fact. The trick is to turn the possibility of copying into an act that restores agency to the act of appropriation, rather than merely adding to the stock of worthless copies that surround us. The key to détournement is not to appropriate the image, but to appropriate the power of appropriation itself”. (Debord & Wolman, 1956).
