In this chapter, I presented the background of counterforensic ludology. In the first subchapter, I defined board games as systemic artifacts that represent social and historical realities through rules and procedures, framing the players' process of meaning-making as an interaction between the gameâ€™s embedded models and the players' mental models. I then explained that games, as cultural objects, contain dominant and subaltern voices reflecting the cultural tensions of the society in which they are created and that, through design, creators prescribe a particular way of resolving these tensions.

In the second subchapter, I defined state violence as the illegitimate use of state force against civilian populations for political purposes, whether directly or indirectly. I argued that this state violence is reproduced in material culture, specifically in board games, and showed how it is suppressed in the dominant texts of these artifacts through internal power operations that function systemically.

In the third subchapter, I presented critical work with board games from ludology, subversion, and experimental approaches. I defined ludology as the formal study of board games, focusing on their simulation layer while also considering their narrative and performative elements. I then introduced subversion as a practice of resistance rooted in the design and art traditions of postcolonial societies, which intervenes in artifacts circulating hegemonic discourses to recover the voices of the dominated. Next, I introduced two experimental methodologies: Object-oriented inquiry and reflexive digitization. I explained that Object-oriented inquiry, and specifically narrative inquiry, allows speculative work with game system information to reconstruct the perspectives and voices of both represented and omitted subaltern actors. Finally, I briefly introduced reflexive digitization as an experimental practice in board game research and design, using digitization as a means to examine, expose, and question the algorithmic structure of these games. This practice is explained further in the Appendix.
