Board games represent political and historical realities through rules and procedures—models—that emulate the workings of social systems (Gonzalo Iglesia, 2016). These designed models are "embedded with cultural and ideological elements from their context of creation" (Iglesia, 2023) and, therefore, include discourses that shape social imaginaries about both contemporary society and the past. Critical game studies have deconstructed these ludic models of history and politics to show how, through the act of simulation, discourses on power, oppression, and the legitimacy of violence are articulated. A body of work demonstrates how seemingly innocuous board games circulate discourses of supremacism, colonialism, racism, and imperialism, legitimizing the violence that dominant groups exert against the dominated (Borit, Borit & Olsen, 2018; Collins, 2021; Flanagan & Jakobsson, 2023).

Recently, there has been a proliferation of games that model internal conflicts, such as civil wars or revolutions (Suckling, 2023), and there is evident interest within the field of game studies in understanding how games construct imaginaries about power. Likewise, critical artists and designers seek to subvert dominant discourses in games that legitimize state violence (Müllner, 2022). However, studies and interventions in board games focused on state violence remain limited.

Next, I will present the concept of state violence and explain how games model this violence explicitly and implicitly, suppressing the perspective of victims to convey their dominant discourses. This will serve to position ludology as a practice that exposes and challenges this state violence by recovering the perspective of the victims.
## 2.2.1. Framing State Violence
One of the political principles of modern states is that they hold legitimate control over violence within their jurisdiction to preserve social order and defend their sovereignty (Davenport, 2007). In the social sciences, this view of state violence has been expanded to include both direct forms of force (i.e., the control of public security) and structural forms (i.e., the denial of public services to a specific population for political or military purposes). Instances have also been identified where the use of violence by the state is legitimate, as well as situations where such use is excessive, unjustified, and illegal.

Illegitimate state violence refers to acts of violence exercised by the state that are perceived as abusive or unjustified, such as genocide or the use of terror against its own citizens (Torres, 2018, p. 387). Blakeley (2016) further explains the difference between legitimate state violence and state terrorism:

>While states claim a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence, in that they claim the right to resort to violence in self-defence, certain acts of state violence are nevertheless prohibited, even in the course of a defensive war. (...) State terrorism involves the deliberate use of violence against individuals that the state has a duty to protect in order to invoke terror in a wider audience. Targeting armed enemy combatants is legitimate in warfare, but certain acts are nevertheless prohibited. These include killing prisoners of war or subjecting them to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. (Blakeley, 2016, p. 68.).

For the reasons outlined above, in this thesis, I refer to state violence to denote the illegitimate use of state force against civilian populations for political purposes, both directly and indirectly.
## 2.2.2.  Modeling State Violence
A board game models state violence when its rules and procedures enable the simulation of acts or events in which state entities or entities aligned with the state exert physical or symbolic violence against the civilian population.

These acts or events can be explicitly described as a rule or action occurring during gameplay, or they can be presented abstractly, consequently players uncover through interpretation or analysis. An example of the explicit representation of state violence is the game _All Bridges Burning: Red Revolt and White Guard in Finland, 1917-1918_ (Arponen, 2020). This game models the Finnish Civil War, allowing one player to assume the role of a state entity, the Finnish Senate. As part of their action repertoire, this player can conduct drastic acts of intimidation, such as the "White Terror," which increases their political power and moves them closer to victory:

>In the historical conflict, Terror took many forms, from more or less unplanned personal acts of revenge to organized persecution, violence, and executions. Elsewhere in the COIN Series, Terror has been conceptualized as serving to undermine state authority by illustrating its inability to protect its citizens. In the context of the Finnish Civil War, however, the power vacuum left by the demise of Russian rule in Finland meant that there was no central state authority to undermine. Gradually, central state authority disappeared altogether and local militias took over in its place. Accordingly, in All Bridges Burning, Terror is conceived as a weapon of intimidation: it deters an enemy Faction’s support for their cause. This is explicitly simulated by the removal of enemy pieces and the additional cost of the enemy’s Rally Command in spaces with a history of enemy Terror.

Although the game's designer explains that during the historical period modeled in _All Bridges Burning_, Finland did not have an established state authority, the "Senate" alludes to the role of the state during the conflict. Similarly, it should be noted that while the "Red" faction player can also carry out acts of "Red Terror," aimed at fulfilling a function similar to that of the "Senate" faction, these entities do not represent state power but rather an insurgent group within society.

The modeling of state violence in a game can reflect the ideologies embedded within it, as well as the rhetorical operations it performs to either question or legitimize these ideologies. In this sense, analyzing how this violence is modeled and how the player is fed back regarding its consequences can be revealing for its critical study. In the game _Nicaragua!_ (Miranda, 1988), which simulates guerrilla warfare in Nicaragua during the 1980s, the "Repression" technique serves as a form of conducting "Intelligence" operations, which both the player representing the "Government" and the one representing the "Rebel" can choose to employ.

>Players use their intelligence capabilities to ferret out covert enemy units so that they may be attacked and eliminated or neutralized. They may do this through normal informer/military channels, or they may elect to use such repressive techniques as indiscriminate arrests and torture. (Miranda, 1988, p.13)
>
>(...) If the phasing player chooses to use repressive techniques in conjunction with his intelligence operations, the possibility of gaining information increases at the expense of alinenating the social classes. (...) A player may use Repression in each Intelligence Operation he performs. (...) Each time the phasing player uses Repression in the Intelligence Phase, the non-phasing player may add 1 to his National Will level or the non-phasing player may move the political marker of any one Social Class present in the Department one box in his favor. (Miranda, 1988, p.15)
>
>The *instant* a player's National Will level goes below the "1" box, regardless of whose turn it is or what phase of the turn it is, that player's side surrenders and his opponent is the winner. (Miranda, 1988, p.19)

Based on the above, it is possible to unravel some ideas about the ludic-discursive function of repression, which can be discerned from the relationship between the game's mechanics and its theme (Booth, 2021, p. 58):

⦁	*Both the State and the insurgents can repress the population.
⦁	Repression can have a positive effect for the faction conducting it.
⦁	Both factions are penalized for doing so.
⦁	Repression of the population negatively impacts player performance but does not determine it.*

From these statements derived from the rules, we can assert that the game positively rewards repression but does not make it an immediate defeat condition. On the contrary, players can strategically use torture and indiscriminate arrests of the civilian population to achieve their political objectives. The critical study of games like _Nicaragua!_ can address the modeling of state violence and assess its ideological and ethical implications.
## 2.2.3. Suppressing the Perspective of the Victims
One of the main challenges for game creators who represent political violence, especially those aiming to "realistically" depict a historical scenario, is establishing the conditions under which the game addresses this violence. For example, Train and Ruhnke explain that counterinsurgency wargames omit the representation of terrorist and genocidal acts in their mechanics to avoid "strongly negative reactions" from players (Train & Ruhnke, 2016, p. 515) [2].

Their alternative is to present wars in a *social vacuum*. The player is rewarded or penalized for choosing to attack civilians, but the consequences of these actions are presented in abstract terms, aligned with the game’s dominant storyline. Alonge (2019) has observed that representing war in a social vacuum can have the rhetorical effect of sanitizing and legitimizing the excesses of war.

The abstraction of victims and the suppression of the consequences of violence from the game's dominant layer is an important design decision. For instance, Alonge has noted how, in certain games, the absence of civilian victims contrasts with the level of detail given to modeling specific aspects of war:

>_Squad Leader_ presents several scenarios that depict urban combat, which is reproduced in a highly detailed way. There are even rules concerning movement in the sewer system. The only significant feature of city environment that is ignored is the presence of civilians. _Squad Leader_’s battles take place in a social vacuum. In Lou Zocchi’s _Luftwaffe_, on the air bombing campaign against Germany, the Allied player must annihilate enemy cities and infrastructures, but the terrible human cost paid by the German population is never mentioned, not even in the historical and designer’s notes. Of course, the main reason why the so-called “collateral damage” is rarely mentioned in wargames is because they focus on the more “exciting” aspects of warfare: maneuvering and fighting. But one could argue that, through blurring the horrors of battle, wargame implicitly makes war acceptable. (Alonge, 2019) 

*All Bridges Burning* and *Nicaragua!* model state violence, but they do not represent victims as entities, nor do they consider them in the game’s objectives: the game does not end based on how many times the population has been attacked. Yet we know this information exists. For example, in a modding exercise for Nicaragua!, we could establish a rule that limits state attacks to a specific number. This would bring victims into the game's dominant layer, making it a game condition to actively count the number of victims. Commercial games are designed so that information about victims and their trajectories remains below the players' threshold of detectability. The systemic procedure of suppressing information about victims and their trajectories from the dominant text is an exercise of power by the game.

*Fig. 2. A screenshot from Call of Duty 4 (Infinity Ward, 2007) showing a perspective similar to military footage displaying airstrikes.*

Mass media, like television and newspapers, consciously conduct these types of operations. For example, television uses another technology, footage, to report (represent) the development of military actions without presenting civilian victims. The origin of the first image (Fig. 1) is part of the footage circulated by the IDF as evidence of the operation in which Mohammed Deif, the military leader of Hamas in Gaza, was killed. By focusing on the state intervention from an aerial perspective, the Israeli army shifts the fate of the 90 civilian victims of its attack to a residual plane, below the viewer’s threshold of detectability. In the second image (Fig. 2), we see a segment from the C130 Airstrike mission in *Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare* (Infinity Ward, 2007), in which the player controls a fixed-wing aircraft to annihilate enemy troops on the ground. As with other war simulation games, the perspective chosen for this mission can be understood as an effort to provide players with an immersive or realistic experience. Ultimately, this design choice allows *Call of Duty* to employ the same rhetorical operation as the IDF, constructing a successful narrative of the war on terror while omitting the presentation of victims.

While there are board games where the representation of state violence centered on victims informs players’ emotional experience (Sterczewski, 2016), this thesis focuses on those games that conveniently abstract or omit it (Mukherjee, 2021). In this sense, I argue for the need for theoretical and practical tools that make it possible to detect information on violence in board games that exist below the detectability threshold.
